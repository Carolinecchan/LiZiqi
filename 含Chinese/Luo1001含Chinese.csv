3065,UgxK7tTx9vC9pt59mmJ4AaABAg,634,"As we can see in the videos, the background of the forest, farms, yards, cooking stoves and utensils are real. In the past especially for the Chinese people our ancestors work hard on every inch of lands they have. They make use of everything that nature provides to them. Generation by generations the land grew flourish. This final generation from baby boomers era (like the grandma) likely the last of their kind, because due to the changes of modern and tech/gadjets world. Not many still living up the life just like showed in the video because the generation X,Y and Z are working and living in cities to find income and mostly leaving the old man/woman at their village. In the end leaving the lands and farms unattended (because grandpa/grandma are already old to work and care the lands).
Most end up selling their land and the money the new generation get were invested in businesses, building or renovating house in the cities or in another country, etc. 
As you saw in the video, you can see herbs, clean ponds and rivers, varieties of vegetations, animals like birds, chicken, duck, are well taken care of. These are their daily source of food because there are no supermarket nearby where you can buy from there. Thus, why need to buy if you can get it fresh from your own farm? Chinese are particular in what they eat (diets and healthy) so they grew herbs, vegetables and live stocks. That is how the baby boomers generation survived along the years away from town or cities. 
The beautiful lady is one of the most impressive grandchild in her family. Not just beautiful but also hardworking, diligent, caring and humble because she still carry on her family's tradition and the lands. She learns all sorts of cooking, fermenting, recipes could be mostly from her grandparents which is oustanding. 
I too once lived like hers until i was 19 years old and i loves everything just like hers until my grandma passed away and the land was sold by my uncle that year. 
The memories I had never perish. I still remember the smell in the morning when I'm standing in the middle of the farm, the morning dewdrops on the leaves and grasses, the sounds of birds and water flowing in the small river, the bamboo forests in the evening like golden, chasing gooses, collecting the chicken eggs, collecting the sap from rubber trees, the soothing cold wind on the pepper farm hills, catching grasshoppers among the grasses, catching fireflies at night, the smell of firewood burning while boiling hot water, the food that my grandma used to cooked, my cousin shouting from afar teasing me while plucking potatoes from the ground, etc. I misses all that when I watched the video. 
I did went back to the village a few years ago but it wasnt the same anymore and the place changed alot and the farm wasnt like it used to be like. The peaceful life that I missed.","正如我们在视频中所看到的那样，森林，农场，院子，烹饪炉和餐具的背景是真实的。过去，尤其是对于中国人民，我们祖先在拥有的每一英寸土地上都在努力工作。他们利用自然界提供的一切。几代人的一代人的土地蓬勃发展。来自婴儿潮一代时代（像奶奶一样）的最后一代可能是同类的最后一代，因为由于现代和技术/gadjets世界的变化。 X，Y和Z一代在城市工作并居住在城市中，并大部分将老人/女人留在他们的村庄里，所以并没有多少人像视频中的生活那样过上生活。最后，离开土地和农场无人看管（因为爷爷/祖母已经在工作和照顾土地上已经老了）。
大多数人最终出售了他们的土地，以及新一代获得的资金投资于企业，在城市或另一个国家建造或翻新房屋等。
正如您在视频中看到的那样，您可以看到草药，干净的池塘和河流，各种植被，鸟类，鸡肉，鸭子等动物。这些是他们的日常食物来源，因为附近没有超市可以从那里购买。因此，如果您可以从自己的农场获得新鲜，为什么还需要购买呢？中国人在吃的东西（饮食和健康）中是特别的，因此他们种植了草药，蔬菜和活蛋。这就是婴儿潮一代在远离城镇或城市的几年中生存的方式。
美丽的女士是她家庭中最令人印象深刻的孙子之一。不仅美丽，而且勤奋，勤奋，关怀和谦虚，因为她仍然具有家人的传统和土地。她了解各种烹饪，发酵，食谱可能主要来自她的祖父母，这是罢工的。
我曾经像她一样像她一样生活，直到我19岁，我都喜欢像她这样的一切，直到我的祖母去世，那一年我的叔叔出售了这片土地。
我从未灭亡的记忆。我仍然记得早晨，当我站在农场中间时，早晨的气味，叶子和草地上的碎屑，小河中鸟类和水的声音，傍晚的竹林像金色一样，追逐鸡蛋，收集鸡蛋，从橡胶树中收集树液，在胡椒农场山上舒缓的冷风，在草中捕捉蚱hoppers，在晚上捕获萤火虫，柴火的气味在沸腾的热水时燃烧，食物，我是我的食物。奶奶曾经煮过，我的堂兄从远处大喊大叫，一边从地上摘下土豆，等等。
几年前，我确实回到了村庄，但不再一样，这个地方改变了很多，农场不像以前那样。我错过的和平生活。"

When you look at cultures that eat some rather unusual foods that for others seems ""gross"" or ""weird"" (snails, frogs, insects, etc) and they dont seemingly exist in a place where there exists a complete lack of options the question becomes ""Why?"" 

I mean can you imagine the first guy who was sitting on a riverbank one day and said, either to himself or someone nearby, ""Ya know what? I am gonna go eat that snail"" or the first person to say ""Boy that frog looks yummy and I bet its legs would be tasty"". I should also point out that in Chinese the word for Frog (when you are using the term in the context of being a food, at least) basically translates into ""Field Chicken"". Specified the context because it has other names just like most things do based on the context of the discussion.","我继续不了解各种文化及其传统食物的一件事是，它首先是如何真正开始的。

当您查看吃一些相当不寻常的食物的文化时，这些食物似乎“粗糙”或“怪异”（蜗牛，青蛙，昆虫等），它们似乎并不存在于存在完全缺乏选择的地方，问题就变成了问题。 “为什么？”

我的意思是，您能想象有一天坐在河岸上的第一个人对自己或附近的人说：“你知道吗？我要去吃那蜗牛了”或第一个说“青蛙看起来的男孩好吃，我敢打赌它的腿会很美味”。我还应该指出，在中文中，青蛙一词（至少在作为食物的背景下使用该术语时）基本上会转化为“野鸡”。指定上下文，因为它具有其他名称，就像大多数事情一样，基于讨论的上下文。"

But showing the true appearance of rural China is not the theme of her video at all. The reason why you see such a beautiful video will cause discomfort because it subverts your impression of China, this is not China you know.
The real China should be messy and the people's quality is low. You are embarrassed and even painful for this. You instinctively resist the beautification of China, so you are skeptical of the video here.
Many people have ""escaped"" or hope to ""escape"" China because of the status quo of contempt China. However, they may not expect that inferiority in their hometown will always be wrapped like a nightmare. When people enjoy the beauty and tranquility of Li Zihuan's video, they feel dislike and anger; when people admire China's development and progress, they will not have a hint of joy; a developed country feels that China's threats want to curb China Some people even become accomplices. Those who despise themselves are actually scornful. China is their demon, as long as they mention them, they will suffer.
I want to remind these people that 1.4 billion people living in China are also flesh and blood, and they are pursuing a happy and peaceful life. They also have their own creativity and imagination. Why can't they create such high -level works? Why can't China be beautiful?
Those who feel that you are offended, if you are abroad, please leave this channel quietly, forget everything about China, and hope that you can live easily and have dignity. If you are in China, please open your eyes and look at everything around you, maybe more beautiful things are waiting for you to discover. Even if you can't find it, spend more time to accompany your family, it is a beautiful thing.


——The above is just written to those Chinese who have been demon","当你们觉得李子柒的视频是假的，中国的农村根本不是这个样子，我想对你们说，中国的农村确实不是这个样子。
但展示中国农村的真实面貌根本不是她视频的主题。你们之所以看到如此唯美的视频时会产生不适，是因为它颠覆了你们对中国的印象，这不是你们了解的中国。
真实的中国应该环境脏乱，人民素质低下。你们为此感到难堪，甚至痛苦。你们本能的抵制美化中国的事物，因此才对这里的视频持怀疑态度。
有许多人因为鄙夷中国的现状“逃出”了或希望“逃出”中国，然而他们也许没料到，对于自己故乡的自卑将永远如梦魇一般缠绕。在人们享受李子柒视频的唯美与恬静时，他们感到的是厌恶和愤怒；在人们赞叹中国的发展进步时，他们也不会有一丝喜悦；某发达国家感受到中国的威胁想要遏制中国时，有些人甚至成为了帮凶。那些鄙夷自己出身的人，其实也在鄙夷着自己。中国是他们的心魔，只要一提起他们就受煎熬。
我想提醒这些人，生活在中国的14亿人口，他们个个也都是有血有肉，他们都在追求幸福平静的生活。他们也都有各自的创造力和想象力，怎么就不能创造出这么高水平的作品来呢？中国怎么就不能有美好的事物了呢？
那些觉得自己受到冒犯的人，如果你身在国外，请你安静的离开这个频道，忘掉关于中国的一切，同时希望你活得轻松些，有尊严些。如果你身在国内，请你睁开眼重新打量一下周围的一切，也许还有更多美的事物等着你去发现。即便发现不了，多花些时间陪陪家人，也是美事一桩。

Please allow me to briefly introduce the incident: Li Ziqi, as an Internet celebrity, then a company found her and proposed to establish a company in partnership with Li Ziqi. The Li Ziqi brand belongs to the company. The company carries out the commercial operation of the Li Ziqi brand. Li Ziqi accounts for 49% of the shares. People who don't understand seem to see that if the company launches ""Li Zi For Qi's brand products, if you earn 100 million yuan a year, Li Ziqi can share 49 million yuan. Of course, naive Li Ziqi thinks the same way. However, the fact is that the company sells or authorizes the ""Li Ziqi"" brand to another company for 1 yuan. At this time, Li Ziqi only has 49% of the shares. She can't stop it. Through this wave of operations, it means that another company produces Li Ziqi brand products. No matter how much billion yuan it earns a year, Li Ziqi has no income of 10 cents. Li Ziqi's theoretical income is only 49% of the brand transfer fee, that is, 49 cents. At this time, it is embarrassing that if Li Ziqi continues to update the video, it is equivalent to advertising others for free. She has no dime of income. She is busy in vain. The agreed 49% of the income is not a dime in the end.

After more than 500 days, she finally won the lawsuit. The two sides have reached a settlement. The source is sent by the official Weibo of the defendant. Let's look forward to it together.","我是中国人。请允许我简要介绍这一事件：作为互联网名人的李齐（Li Ziqi），然后一家公司找到了她，并提议与李齐（Li Ziqi）建立一家公司。 Li Ziqi品牌属于该公司。该公司进行了Li Ziqi品牌的商业运营。 Li Ziqi占股票的49％。那些不了解的人似乎看到，如果该公司推出“李Zi为Qi的品牌产品推出，那么如果您每年赚取1亿元人民币，Li Ziqi可以分享4,900万元。但是，事实是，该公司向另一家公司销售或授权“ Li Ziqi”品牌1元。目前，Li Ziqi只有49％的股份。她无法停止。 ，这意味着另一家公司生产Li Ziqi品牌产品。无论其一年的收入多少亿元，Li Ziqi都没有10美分的收入。LiZiqi的理论收入仅占品牌转让费的49％，即49 Cents。目前，令人尴尬的是，如果Li Ziqi继续更新视频，那等同于免费广告别人。她没有收入。她徒劳无功。商定的49％的收入不是一角钱最后。

经过500天以上，她终于赢得了诉讼。双方已经达成解决方案。消息人士由被告的官方微博发送。让我们一起期待它。"

5981,UgxvAuJTFlMG5TuJm3F4AaABAg,0,"If you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about Liziqi ( Li Ziyi ): 

In 1990, Li Ziyi fell to the ground in Mianyang, Sichuan. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Later, her father died, and Li Ziyi became an orphan. His stepmother didnโ€t treat her well. Li Zizhen mentioned on Weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten. 

Grandpa and Grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take Li Ziyu home and live. When Li Ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. At the age of 14, Li Ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. Her first life was very hard. She slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months. 

Li Ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. In order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. Later, when talking about the matter, Li Zizhen frankly said: โ€I didnโ€t say that I liked music at that time, just to live, I felt that it was well paid.โ€ 

In 2012, because grandma was ill once, Li Ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. โ€Being closer, I feel more at ease.โ€ 

After returning, Li Ziyi opened a Taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. In 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, Li Ziyi was exposed to the short video platform Meipai. Until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on Meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of Taobao business, Li Ziyi re-entered Meipai to prepare for his own video program. 

The reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment. 

In an interview with the living room of Sina Club, Li Ziyi mentioned, โ€All these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. In the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places. 

In the beginning, Li Ziyi gave himself a topic called โ€Four Seasons Change, Eat While You Eatโ€. After the suggestion of Meipai editor, it became โ€Ancient Foodโ€ and it is still used today. 

In September 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for Li Ziyu to get more attention in the future. Sina Weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support. 

As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Liu Tongming brought her Weibo resources support. 

One day in September 2016, Li Feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private Weibo message from โ€Mr. Lโ€. Mr. L expressed his love for Li Ziyuโ€s video content, felt that he had fulfilled his Taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her. 

For a long time after that, Li Ziyi received Mr. Lโ€s private letter. โ€It would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. This is usChinaโ€s proud traditional culture should be seen by people in China and around the world. โ€Mr. L said in a private message. 

At first, after seeing these private messages, Li Ziyi didnโ€t care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. Until one day, Mr. L came to the city where Li Zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. Mr. Lโ€s politeness and clear logical thinking made Li slowly drop his initial alert. 

This accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of Li Zizhen. Not long after the meal was over, with the help of Mr. L, Li Zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on Sina Weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing Li Zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head. 

This experience is partly recorded in a diary of Li Zizheng that year. Some insiders close to the senior executives of Weinian Technology confirmed to Tencentโ€s โ€Shenwangโ€ that the โ€Mr. Lโ€ is actually Liu Tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. Daxiong Liu, the founder of Wei Nian Technology, an MCN company to which Li Zizhen now belongs. 

On December 8th, the reading volume of a Weibo topic labeled โ€Is Li Ziyi a cultural outputโ€ climbed to 800 million. Li Zizheng was once again on the hot search list. 

The video created by Li Ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now. 

Extensive overseas communication is an important reason for Li Zihuanโ€s renewed attention. Some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional Chinese culture and cuisine. Others think that her video is not completely true To reflect Chinaโ€s rural life. 

Even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a DJ, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life Itโ€s still just a fiction for character setting. 

An insider of Weinian Technology told Tencentโ€s โ€Deep Webโ€ that Li Ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by Li Ziyi himself. The popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. In fact, both Li Zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs. 

Until August 17, 2018, Li Ziyiโ€s eponymous Tmall store officially opened. Six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. A year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the Li Zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million. 
The value behind Li Ziyiโ€s IP is being quickly tapped. 

Li Ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. But now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements. 
According to Tianyan search, โ€Deep Webโ€ shows that MCN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., which Li Ziyi belongs to, was established on February 28, 2013, with a registered capital of RMB 5.208 million. According to the introduction, Wei Nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates KOL into IP through short videos and extends to consumer brands. 

The information of Qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark โ€Li Zihuanโ€. The applicant companies are Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd. The product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, Financial property management, catering and accommodation. 

Not only that, Wei Nian also has inextricable links with Li Ziyuโ€s companies. 

According to the eye inspection, Li Jiajia (should be the original name of Li Ziyu) established Sichuan Ziyu Culture Communication Co., Ltd. on July 20, 2017, and Wei Nian is its shareholder, holding 51% of the shares. Supervisor, Li Jiajia holds 49% of the shares. 

According to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., including Greenland Holdings, ZTE, Xinhua Media, Vanke, Light Media, etc. . 
Among the shareholders of Weinian Technology, Sina Weibo is particularly eye-catching. 

From Wei Nian Technology to Sina Weibo, Li Ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to. 
In her own words, she changed from โ€a little transparent to a person who is so useless to societyโ€. After entering the public view and being noticed by more people, Li Ziyiโ€s sense of responsibility has also become heavier. 
โ€I want to do what I can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non-heritage cultural craftsmen, and I want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. Li Ziyi said. 

Source: https://www.ww01.net/en/archives/33757","如果您在这里是新手，那么这绝对是您需要了解的有关Liziqi（Li Ziyi）的一切：

1990年，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）跌倒在四川米扬（Mianyang）。她的父母很小的时候就离婚了。后来，她的父亲去世了，李齐伊成为孤儿。他的继母对她不好。李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）在微博上提到，当他的继母将头发拖入排水沟并被殴打时，他有半死的经历。

爷爷和奶奶使孙女感到沮丧，最后决定带李Ziyu回家。当李齐伊（Li Ziyi）五年级时，他的祖父再次去世，他的祖母很难抚养她继续上学。李齐（Li Ziyi）在14岁时不得不辍学，独自去城市努力工作，并开始了八年的流浪生活。她的第一人生非常艰难。她睡在公园椅上，挠头两个月。

Li Ziyi还曾在酒店担任服务生，每月薪水为300元。为了赚取更多的收入，她去学习演奏唱片并在酒吧里唱歌。后来，在谈论此事时，李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）坦率地说：“我不是说当时我喜欢音乐，只是为了生活，我觉得这是付出的。”

2012年，由于奶奶曾经生病，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）担心她后来会后悔，扔掉所有工作并返回奶奶。 “靠近，我感到更加放松。”

返回后，李Ziyi开了一家淘宝商店，但业务一直在运行，他几乎没有吃饭。 2015年，在他的弟弟的影响下，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）接触了短视频平台Meipai。直到2016年，看到他的弟弟在Meipai上有一些粉丝，并且拥有更多的粉丝可以改善淘宝业务的心态，Li Ziyi重新进入Meipai，为自己的视频节目做准备。

她之所以选择以这种风格拍摄视频与她的童年环境密切相关的原因。

李·齐（Li Ziyi）在接受西那俱乐部（Nina Club）的客厅采访时说：“所有这些在农村自给自足的事情，对我来说，它们嫉妒。在简短的视频中，她选择从最熟悉的地方开始。

一开始，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）称自己为“四个季节变化，吃饭时吃饭”。在Meipai编辑的建议之后，它变成了“古老的食物”，并且今天仍然使用。

2016年9月，一个新的机会悄悄地出现了，这也成为李Zyu将来更加关注的重要推动者。 Sina Weibo开始公开寻找更多出色的简短视频创建者以获得资源支持。

正如文章开头所述，刘·汤明（Liu Tongming）为她带来了微博的资源支持。

2016年9月的一天，古老的简短视频博客作者Li Feng意外收到了“先生先生的私人微博消息”。 L”。 L先生表达了对李Ziyu的视频内容的热爱，觉得他已经实现了他的作陶王的梦，并希望与她见面。

此后很长一段时间，Li Ziyi收到了L先生的私人信。 “这样一个好视频让这个人看到它是可惜的。这是中国和世界各地的人们应该看到USCHINA骄傲的传统文化。 “先生。我在一条私人消息中说。

起初，在看到这些私人消息后，李Ziyi并不在乎太多，甚至不必担心遇到骗子。直到一天，L先生来到了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）所在的城市，并想请她吃饭和聊天。 L先生的礼貌和清晰的逻辑思维使李慢慢地放弃了最初的警报。

这次偶然的会议彻底改变了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）的生活轨迹。用餐结束后不久，在L先生的帮助下，李·Zizheng（Li Zizheng）得到了Sina Weibo的大量资源的支持，加快了她的知名度，并允许Li Zizhen赶到头部网络影响者的排队。

这种经历部分记录在那年的李Zizheng日记中。一些与温尼安技术高级管理人员接近的内部人士证实了腾讯的“申旺”，即“先生先生L”实际上是刘·汤明（Liu Tongming），他的化名是公开报道的。 Wei Nian Technology的创始人Daxiong Liu是Li Zizhen现在属于的MCN公司。

12月8日，一个标有“是文化产出”的微博主题的阅读量攀升至8亿。李Zizheng再次在热门搜索列表中。

Li Ziyi和她创建的视频现在已成为一个值得研究的现象。

广泛的海外沟通是李齐伊安（Li Zihuan）重新关注的重要原因。有人说她已经拍摄了理想的乡村生活，并传播了中国传统文化和美食的魅力。其他人则认为她的视频并非完全正确地反映中国的乡村生活。

自从爆炸再次提出以来一直很受欢迎的疑问，例如成为DJ，成为富人的第二代，无论是我自己的视频，是否有强烈的推动力，视频是真的对于农村生活，这仍然是角色环境的小说。

Weinian Technology的一位内部人士告诉Tencent的“ Deep Web”，Li Ziyi是普通的，相关的视频内容是由Li Ziyi本人制作的。受欢迎程度不是公司和他本人的倡议。实际上，他背后的李·齐伊安（Li Zihuan）和微读团队都非常低调，他们非常热情，拒绝了当前的所有采访需求。

直到2018年8月17日，Li Ziyi的同名TMALL商店正式开业。上网六天后，当时只有五种产品的商店的销售额超过150,000，销售额超过1000万。一年后，李Zizhen旗舰店展示的21种产品的总销售额超过130万，总销售额达到7100万。
Li Ziyi的IP背后的价值正在迅速挖掘。

Li Ziyi从头开始，并以自己的力量获得了第一批粉丝。但是现在，声名和财富的受欢迎程度和收益显然不再只是她的成就。
根据Tianyan Search的说法，“ Deep Web”表明，Li Ziyi属于的McN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。于2013年2月28日成立，其注册资本为5.208亿元。根据引言，Wei Nian是一家娱乐娱乐公司，通过简短的视频将KOL孵化为IP，并扩展到消费者品牌。

Qixinbao的信息表明，商标“ Li Zihuan”有100多种知识产权信息。申请人公司是Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。产品类别包括食品，服装，鞋子和帽子，染料和脂肪，染料和脂肪，啤酒和饮料，金融物业管理，餐饮和住宿。

不仅如此，Wei Nian还与Li Ziyu的公司建立了不可忽视的联系。

根据眼睛检查，李亚吉亚（应该是李祖的原始名称）于2017年7月20日成立了四川Ziyu文化传播公司有限公司。主管Li Jiajia持有49％的股份。

根据其他数据，Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。的背后有多达50家受益公司，包括Greenland Holdings，ZTE，新华社媒体，Vanke，Light Media等。
在Weinian技术的股东中，Sina Weibo特别引人注目。

从Wei Nian Technology到Sina Weibo，Li Ziyi逐渐拥有互联网名人期待的最佳卡片。
用她自己的话说，她从“有点透明变成了一个对社会无用的人”。在进入公众观点并被更多人注意到之后，李齐的责任感也变得更加重。
“我想尽我所能，做更多对社会有益的事情，例如传统文化，非遗产文化工匠的传播，我想向所有人展示这些旧事物，以便更多的人知道。李Ziyi说。

Wanli Great Wall, Confucius, and cheongsam are all Korean culture in history. Confucius was born in Qingzhou, South Korea. He has the parents of Korean bloodlines. The Great Wall of Wanli was built by Koreans to protect the Korean Peninsula from being attacked by enemies. Cheongsam is also a deformed clothes in Hanbok. When the Koreans want to dress up, they wear Hanbok, and they wear cheongsam when they sleep.

万里长城、孔子、旗袍在历史上都是韩国的文化。 孔子出生在韩国的庆州，有韩国血统的父母，万里长城是韩国人为保护韩半岛免遭敌人袭击而建造的。 旗袍也是韩服中变形的衣服。 韩国人想打扮的时候穿韩服，睡觉的时候没有格调的场合穿旗袍。 现在可以看到中国的少数民族穿旗袍，那是借着很久之前的韩国文化维持至今的。

Guys, I hope that you can see my comment. I'm here to tell you something about her childhood and now. As far as I'm concerned, her mother passed away when she was little. Soon after, her father married another woman. Her stepmother was mean, she was like every stepmother you've read about in the fairy tales. Ziqi was forced to do all the housework, she didn't even get to go to school usually. Her grandparents were very supportive to her and protected her, they are the most important people to her. Her father passed away then, and Idk what happened to her stepmother after that. She then quit school and came to the cities to work as much as she could to help her grandparents. She has been a waitress, a DJ and all the other stuffs. But then, her granddad passed away, and her grandmother as you all see in the videos was sick. So she quit everything and came back to her hometown to take care of her grandmother although she knew that the finance would be a burden. She then figured out how to make a video. She made the video how to dye cloth by grapes' skin and people love it. She did all the work by herself and try again countless times. One video that is making Chinese noodles, everytime she has set the camera angle, the dough got dry and she cannot use it anymore. So she had to make the dough by scratch again and again to record. The dough that was dry, she then baked them into bread for her and her mother to eat. She then said that she was scared just looking at the bread for a while. When she had some money earned from the videos, she hired some camera men, just 2 or 3, to support her. But the fame and popularity have led to her lack of privacy. Papparazi, fly cams are all over her house, she feels really sorry and somehow guilty to her grandmother because of that. She suggested moving to another house but her grandmother told that she had lived in the house for her entire life, so she wouldn't want to move. Some people may say that the videos are fake, that she didn't actually do what was shown in the videos, she just shows her hardworking hands. She really has had an unfortunate childhood, so she deserves what she has today. Please, if you find my comment interesting, leave a like. This is based on my own knowledge so if I'm wrong, let me know. You can support her by clicking the ads or watching it till the end. Thank you ❤","ốngkínhtâybắc订户
伙计们，希望您能看到我的评论。我在这里告诉您有关她的童年和现在的信息。就我而言，她的母亲小时候去世了。不久之后，她的父亲嫁给了另一个女人。她的继母是卑鄙的，她就像您在童话故事中读过的每个继母一样。 Ziqi被迫进行所有家务劳动，她通常甚至都没有上学。她的祖父母对她非常支持并保护她，他们是她最重要的人。她父亲那时去世了，在那之后她的继母发生了什么事。然后，她退出学校，来到城市尽可能多地工作以帮助她的祖父母。她一直是女服务员，DJ和所有其他东西。但是随后，她的爷爷去世了，当你在视频中看到的那样，她的祖母病了。因此，她辞去一切，然后回到家乡照顾祖母，尽管她知道财务将是一个负担。然后，她想出了如何制作视频。她制作了视频如何用葡萄的皮肤染色布，人们喜欢它。她自己做所有的工作，然后无数次重试。一个正在制作中国面条的视频，每次设置相机角度时，面团都会干燥，她再也无法使用它了。因此，她不得不一次又一次地划痕才能记录下来。干燥的面团，然后将它们烤成面包供她和她的母亲吃。然后，她说她只是害怕看面包一段时间。当她从视频中赚钱时，她雇用了一些只有2或3个相机的人来支持她。但是，名望和受欢迎程度导致她缺乏隐私。帕帕拉西（Papparazi），苍蝇凸轮都在她的房子上，因此，她对祖母感到非常抱歉，并以某种方式感到内gui。她建议搬到另一所房子，但她的祖母告诉她一生都住在房子里，所以她不想搬家。有些人可能会说这些视频是假的，她实际上没有做视频中显示的事情，她只是展示了勤奋的手。她确实有一个不幸的童年，所以她应该得到今天的一切。请，如果您觉得我的评论很有趣，请留下类似。这是基于我自己的知识，所以如果我错了，请告诉我。您可以通过单击广告或观看直到最后来支持她。谢谢"
