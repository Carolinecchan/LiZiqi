(ive also shown these videos to my dad and he also loves them, my entire family is full of cooks so this was a breath of fresh air)",我妈妈每天都会每天煮正宗的菲律宾食物，而大约一年前，她失去了与癌症的斗争后，我从来没有像从学校回家回家的感觉，闻到了有史以来最令人惊叹的食物。您的视频带回了这些记忆，食物的煎炸在您的视频中听起来一样，她在锅中扔食物，锅上的金属刮擦，我什至可以闻到屏幕上发生的事情。您的视频使我免于忘记她，您的视频在那些黑暗的时期帮助了我，尽管它不是菲律宾的食物，但您的烹饪方式与我妈妈的烹饪方式如此相似。谢谢你。 （我还向我的父亲展示了这些视频，他也爱他们，我的整个家庭都充满了厨师，所以这是新鲜空气的呼吸）

3065,UgxK7tTx9vC9pt59mmJ4AaABAg,634,"as we can see in the videos, the background of the forest, farms, yards, cooking stoves and utensils are real. in the past especially for the chinese people our ancestors work hard on every inch of lands they have. they make use of everything that nature provides to them. generation by generations the land grew flourish. this final generation from baby boomers era (like the grandma) likely the last of their kind, because due to the changes of modern and tech/gadjets world. not many still living up the life just like showed in the video because the generation x,y and z are working and living in cities to find income and mostly leaving the old man/woman at their village. in the end leaving the lands and farms unattended (because grandpa/grandma are already old to work and care the lands).
most end up selling their land and the money the new generation get were invested in businesses, building or renovating house in the cities or in another country, etc. 
as you saw in the video, you can see herbs, clean ponds and rivers, varieties of vegetations, animals like birds, chicken, duck, are well taken care of. these are their daily source of food because there are no supermarket nearby where you can buy from there. thus, why need to buy if you can get it fresh from your own farm? chinese are particular in what they eat (diets and healthy) so they grew herbs, vegetables and live stocks. that is how the baby boomers generation survived along the years away from town or cities. 
the beautiful lady is one of the most impressive grandchild in her family. not just beautiful but also hardworking, diligent, caring and humble because she still carry on her family's tradition and the lands. she learns all sorts of cooking, fermenting, recipes could be mostly from her grandparents which is oustanding. 
i too once lived like hers until i was 19 years old and i loves everything just like hers until my grandma passed away and the land was sold by my uncle that year. 
the memories i had never perish. i still remember the smell in the morning when i'm standing in the middle of the farm, the morning dewdrops on the leaves and grasses, the sounds of birds and water flowing in the small river, the bamboo forests in the evening like golden, chasing gooses, collecting the chicken eggs, collecting the sap from rubber trees, the soothing cold wind on the pepper farm hills, catching grasshoppers among the grasses, catching fireflies at night, the smell of firewood burning while boiling hot water, the food that my grandma used to cooked, my cousin shouting from afar teasing me while plucking potatoes from the ground, etc. i misses all that when i watched the video. 
i did went back to the village a few years ago but it wasnt the same anymore and the place changed alot and the farm wasnt like it used to be like. the peaceful life that i missed.","正如我们在视频中所看到的那样，森林，农场，院子，烹饪炉和餐具的背景是真实的。过去，尤其是对于中国人民，我们祖先在拥有的每一英寸土地上都在努力工作。他们利用自然界提供的一切。几代人的一代人的土地蓬勃发展。来自婴儿潮一代时代（像奶奶一样）的最后一代可能是同类的最后一代，因为由于现代和技术/gadjets世界的变化。 X，Y和Z一代在城市工作并居住在城市中，并大部分将老人/女人留在他们的村庄里，所以并没有多少人像视频中的生活那样过上生活。最后，离开土地和农场无人看管（因为爷爷/祖母已经在工作和照顾土地上已经老了）。
大多数人最终出售了他们的土地，以及新一代获得的资金投资于企业，在城市或另一个国家建造或翻新房屋等。
正如您在视频中看到的那样，您可以看到草药，干净的池塘和河流，各种植被，鸟类，鸡肉，鸭子等动物。这些是他们的日常食物来源，因为附近没有超市可以从那里购买。因此，如果您可以从自己的农场获得新鲜，为什么还需要购买呢？中国人在吃的东西（饮食和健康）中是特别的，因此他们种植了草药，蔬菜和活蛋。这就是婴儿潮一代在远离城镇或城市的几年中生存的方式。
美丽的女士是她家庭中最令人印象深刻的孙子之一。不仅美丽，而且勤奋，勤奋，关怀和谦虚，因为她仍然具有家人的传统和土地。她了解各种烹饪，发酵，食谱可能主要来自她的祖父母，这是罢工的。
我曾经像她一样像她一样生活，直到我19岁，我都喜欢像她这样的一切，直到我的祖母去世，那一年我的叔叔出售了这片土地。
我从未灭亡的记忆。我仍然记得早晨，当我站在农场中间时，早晨的气味，叶子和草地上的碎屑，小河中鸟类和水的声音，傍晚的竹林像金色一样，追逐鸡蛋，收集鸡蛋，从橡胶树中收集树液，在胡椒农场山上舒缓的冷风，在草中捕捉蚱hoppers，在晚上捕获萤火虫，柴火的气味在沸腾的热水时燃烧，食物，我是我的食物。奶奶曾经煮过，我的堂兄从远处大喊大叫，一边从地上摘下土豆，等等。
几年前，我确实回到了村庄，但不再一样，这个地方改变了很多，农场不像以前那样。我错过的和平生活。"

and yes, not all land is fertile, that's why you don't try to live in a desert like all the morons in arizona and many other places. you can turn many deserts into grassland: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpthi7o66pi&t=4s 

we grow fields upon fields upon fields of corn and soy to make garbage food that makes us sick while having useless lawns to show off to our neighbors that we can use a lawnmower when we could be making prime habitats for massive herds of animals that we can use as never ending food sources.

you can't afford to live off the land? that makes no sense, do you understand the concept here? you're living off the land, you don't need money.. nobody needs money for anything. it's worthless paper and digits in computers. you realize a couple hundred years ago people just rode wagons across america and picked a spot to settle right? i don't know the immediate answer to how to get land distributed to people who are willing to homestead, that's the hard part. i definitely wouldn't want the government involved. there is no easy solution for it, but the alternative is much worse. houses will be completely unaffordable throughout the world some day, and we'll all be even more of slaves to the corporate systems and governments than we already are. just wait, or just wait for your children to see... it's going to be a fucking nightmare. and it's going to happen, you're not getting the world to homestead, nobody is doing it. we're going the other direction and it's not stoppable.

ya, the population is growing, but as i said, you don't seem to have a clue how much land is out there, and people who cannot live off the land shouldn't be living.. why do you think we got into this situation? we cater to every little desire and whim of everybody all in the name of profit. if you have a strong family and community you can live off the land, anybody can do it, it's just a matter of not being a coddled sheltered half ass human being.

sure.. we've dug ourselves into a hole by chasing the dollars and carrots in front of our faces for centuries, but the solution has been staring us in the face the entire time.. most people are just too lazy and don't want to give up their lives of convenience for an honest living off the land. if you don't want an honest lifestyle living off the land and you want to live in a city full of conveniences and cancers then you're the problem. but you're in good company, probably 99% of people think that way. 

social backlash? like the social backlash from politics, unjust laws, and profiteering? just wait, you haven't even seen social backlash yet, this world is about to explode with social backlash. you're going to wish you had a homestead off the grid when it does.

the fact that i have to explain this to people shows how far gone the majority of mankind is. it's almost a shame that god has promised not to flood the earth again, we could really use a reset.","@johnvuu4679地球上有很多土地，你甚至在任何地方开车吗？您是否曾经离开过您居住的城市？与那里的城市相比，城市的规格很小。

是的，并非所有的土地都是肥沃的，这就是为什么您不像亚利桑那州和其他许多地方那样尝试生活在沙漠中的原因。您可以将许多沙漠变成草地：https：//www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpthi7o66pi&t=4S

我们在玉米和大豆的田地上种植田地，以制作垃圾食品，使我们生病，而无用的草坪可以向我们的邻居炫耀，我们可以在我们可以为大量动物群创造主要栖息地时使用割草机，我们可以使用割草机。用作永无止境的食物来源。

您负担不起居住的土地吗？那没有道理，您在这里了解这个概念吗？您在土地上生活，不需要钱..没人需要任何钱。这是毫无价值的纸和计算机中的数字。您意识到几百年前，人们只是骑着货车在整个美国都骑着货车，并选择了一个地点来定居吗？我不知道如何将土地分配给愿意居住的人的直接答案，这是困难的部分。我绝对不希望政府参与其中。没有简单的解决方案，但是替代方案更糟。有一天，全世界的房屋将完全负担不起，与我们现在相比，我们所有人都将成为公司系统和政府的奴隶。等一下，或者等待您的孩子看到...这将是一场他妈的噩梦。这将发生，您不会让世界进入宅基地，没有人在做。我们朝另一个方向前进，这是不可停止的。

是的，人口正在增长，但是正如我说的那样，您似乎不知道那里有多少土地，而无法生活的人不应该生存。这个情况？我们以利润的名义迎合每个人的每一个小小的渴望和兴起。如果您有一个强大的家庭和社区，您可以在土地上生活，任何人都可以做到这一点，这只是一个不做一个顽固的庇护半屁股人的问题。

当然..我们已经通过在脸前追着美元和胡萝卜数百年来挖掘了一个洞，但是解决方案一直在整个脸上盯着我们。想要放弃他们的便利生活，以诚实地生活在土地上。如果您不希望诚实的生活方式在土地上生活，而是想住在一个充满便利和癌症的城市中，那么您就是问题所在。但是您的公司很好，大概有99％的人以这种方式思考。

社交反弹？就像政治，不公正法律和盈利的社会反对一样？等一下，您甚至还没有看到社交反弹，这个世界即将在社交反弹的情况下爆炸。您将希望在电网上拥有一个宅基地。

我必须向人们解释这一事实，这表明了大多数人类已经走了多远。上帝已承诺不要再次淹没地球几乎是可惜的，我们可以真正使用重置。"

7144,Ugw-o282MUl61tO4u6N4AaABAg,4,"the one thing about various cultures and their traditional foods that i continue to not understand is how it ever really began in the first place. 

when you look at cultures that eat some rather unusual foods that for others seems ""gross"" or ""weird"" (snails, frogs, insects, etc) and they dont seemingly exist in a place where there exists a complete lack of options the question becomes ""why?"" 

i mean can you imagine the first guy who was sitting on a riverbank one day and said, either to himself or someone nearby, ""ya know what? i am gonna go eat that snail"" or the first person to say ""boy that frog looks yummy and i bet its legs would be tasty"". i should also point out that in chinese the word for frog (when you are using the term in the context of being a food, at least) basically translates into ""field chicken"". specified the context because it has other names just like most things do based on the context of the discussion.","我继续不了解各种文化及其传统食物的一件事是，它首先是如何真正开始的。

当您查看吃一些相当不寻常的食物的文化时，这些食物似乎“粗糙”或“怪异”（蜗牛，青蛙，昆虫等），它们似乎并不存在于存在完全缺乏选择的地方，问题就变成了问题。 “为什么？”

我的意思是，您能想象有一天坐在河岸上的第一个人对自己或附近的人说：“你知道吗？我要去吃那蜗牛了”或第一个说“青蛙看起来的男孩好吃，我敢打赌它的腿会很美味”。我还应该指出，在中文中，青蛙一词（至少在作为食物的背景下使用该术语时）基本上会转化为“野鸡”。指定上下文，因为它具有其他名称，就像大多数事情一样，基于讨论的上下文。"

4589,UgwvTSx2InKXqlHYop54AaABAg,1,"brazilian cuisine is the result of a mixture of european, indigenous and african ingredients. many of the components of the recipes and preparation techniques are of indigenous origin, having undergone modifications by the portuguese and slaves from africa. these made adaptations of their typical dishes replacing the missing ingredients with local correspondents. the brazilian feijoada, a typical dish of the country, is an example of this. the slaves brought to brazil since the middle of the 16th century added elements such as palm oil and couscous to national cuisine. and the waves of immigrants received by the country between the 19th and 20th centuries, coming in large numbers from europe, brought some novelties to the national menu and concomitantly strengthened the consumption of various ingredients.

daily food, made in three meals, involves the consumption of coffee with milk, bread, fruits, cakes and sweets for breakfast, beans and rice for lunch - the brazilian's basic meal, to which are sometimes added pasta , meat, salad and potatoes - and, for dinner, soups and also the various regional foods.

distilled beverages were brought by the portuguese or, like cachaça, made on the land. wine is also widely consumed, sometimes added to water and sugar, in the well-known sangria. beer in turn began to be consumed in the late 18th century and is today one of the most common alcoholic drinks.

the most visible regional cuisines belong to the states of minas gerais and bahia, with minas gerais cuisine marked by european influence in delicacies and dairy products such as tropeiro beans (also a dish from são paulo cuisine), cheese bread (which is equivalent to paraguayan chipa, differing in format) and the cheese from minas frescal, and bahian cuisine due to the presence of african delicacies such as acarajé, abará and vatapá. pernambuco's cuisine stands out for its so-called ""pernambuco sweets"", that is, the sweets developed during the colonial and imperial periods in its sugar mills such as the bolo de bolo, souza leão cake and top hat, and also for drinks and savory delicacies discovered or probably originated in the state, such as cachaça, beiju and feijoada à brasileira.","巴西美食是欧洲，土著和非洲成分混合的结果。食谱和制备技术的许多组成部分都是土著起源，对葡萄牙人进行了修改和非洲的奴隶进行了修改。这些对其典型的菜肴进行了改编，用当地的记者代替了缺失的成分。巴西Feijoada是该国典型的菜肴，就是一个例子。自16世纪中叶以来，这些奴隶带到了巴西，增加了棕榈油和国家美食等蒸粗麦的元素。该国在19至20世纪收到的移民浪潮，来自欧洲的数量很大，为国家菜单带来了一些新颖性，并加强了各种成分的消费。

每日食物，三顿饭，涉及牛奶，面包，水果，蛋糕和糖果的咖啡，午餐的豆类和米饭 - 巴西的基本餐，有时会添加意大利面，肉，沙拉，沙拉和土豆 - 而且，晚餐，汤以及各种区域性食品。

蒸馏饮料是由葡萄牙人或像Cachaça一样在土地上制成的。葡萄酒也被广泛消耗，有时在著名的桑格利亚汽酒中添加到水和糖中。反过来，啤酒在18世纪后期开始消耗掉，如今已成为最常见的酒精饮料之一。

最明显的区域美食属于Minas Gerais和Bahia的州，Minas Gerais美食在美味佳肴和乳制品（例如Tropeiro Beans）（也是Tropeiro Beans）（也是圣保罗菜的菜肴），奶酪面包（与Paraguayan相当于Paraguayan ance of Paraguayan breads of tropeiro beans and Dish菜肴）。 Chipa，格式不同）和来自Minas Frescal的奶酪，以及由于存在Acarajé，Abará和Vatapá等非洲美食而导致的Bahian Cuisine。 Pernambuco的美食以其所谓的“ Pernambuco Sweets”而脱颖而出，也就是说，在其糖厂的殖民时期和帝国时期开发的糖果，例如Bolo de Bolo，SouzaLeão蛋糕和顶级帽子，也用于饮料，饮料，咸味发现或可能起源于该州的美味佳肴，例如Cachaça，Beiju和FeijoadaàBrasileira。"

in fact, the biggest reason for ziyi to sue the original company was that the original company secretly registered the trademark of ""li ziyi"", which means that if zi yi sat and ignored, the ownership of the ""li ziyi"" related trademarks will not be owned by her, so back to the company, how do you do this? li ziyi, this ip was before the cooperation with ""weisun"", and the behavior of ""micro -minded"" was too moral.

and the most profitable is the peripheral foods launched by the ""li ziyi"" trademark, such as ""snail powder"" and ""moon cakes"". ""the cooperation model is"" ziyi is responsible for video content creation, and the promotion of social media is subtle "", that is, so many years of ziyi only have only rely on the works taken by himself to obtain the income, but wei nian really relies on the signboard of"" li ziyi "" when the most beautiful scenery, a snail powder can sell for more than 2 billion years. ziyi can't get money, and even the three words ""li ziyi"" will be taken away. in the event that the brand ip of ""li ziyi"" is messed up, the most affected is ziyi himself. because the capital can be found to find other people. but such a good image ip cannot fall into the hands of ""capital"".

fortunately, ziyi regained all the relevant trademark ownership of ""li ziyi"", and the ratio of ziyi in the ""sichuan ziyi cultural company"" also had the previous 49 %, which became 99 %. basically, zi zi has been fighting the ownership of his ""name"" in the past two years.

it turns out that capital can really be so terrible. utilizing people √ business does not understand the law, it can be ""legal"" to swallow her ""intellectual property rights"" in disguise.","@SAiS55 这个不好说，因为收入分配的问题我们也不清楚。但是子柒曾在微博上说过，所有社交平台的账号都是归子柒所有。

其实，子柒告原公司最大的原因就是，原公司偷偷把“李子柒”注册商标，也就是说如果子柒坐而不管，以后“李子柒”相关的商标所有权就不归她所拥有，是归公司的，这怎么行呢？李子柒这个ip是子柒在和“微念”合作之前就有的，“微念”的行为太不道德了。

并且最赚钱的是“微念”利用“李子柒”商标推出的周边食品，像“螺蛳粉”“月饼”等等，“子柒”几乎分不到什么钱，“子柒”和“微念”的合作模式是“子柒负责视频内容创作，微妙负责社交媒体的推广”，也就是说这么多年子柒只有靠自己拍摄的作品来获取收益，然而微念确靠着“李子柒”这个招牌，最风光的时候单单一个螺蛳粉就能卖出20多亿一年的销售额。子柒分不到钱也就罢了，连“李子柒”这三个字也要被夺走，万一以后微念搞砸了“李子柒”这个品牌ip，最受影响的是子柒本人，因为资本吸完血可以找其他人。但是“李子柒”这么好的形象ip是不能落入“资本”的手里。

很庆幸，子柒夺回了“李子柒”所有相关的商标所有权，并且子柒在“四川子柒文化公司”中的股权比例也有之前的49％，变为99％，微念只持有1％，基本上子柒过去2年都是在争夺自己“名字”的所有权。

原来资本真的可以这么可怕，利用人们√商业对法律的不了解，可以“合法”的变相侵吞她人的“知识产权”简直是让人后备发凉"

[easy to solve] the nobility of virtue is naturally high. everyone respects his virtue, not appearance. those who have talented people have excellent ability to deal with things, and their reputation is naturally extraordinary. however, what people admire and admire are his ability to do things, not because he is good at boasting.

[easy to solve] when you have the ability to serve everyone, don't be selfish, just consider yourself, reluctant to pay. for the talents of others, you should learn, appreciate, and admire, not criticism, jealousy, and slander. don't please be rich, and don't be proud of themselves in front of the poor, or despise them. you should not like the new and hate the old. you must cherish old friends or old things, and do not be greedy for new friends or new things. when others are busy, don't disturb him. when others are in a bad mood or are physically and mentally arbitrary, don't gossip to interfere with him and increase his troubles and anxiety.

[easy to solve] don't expose the shortcomings of others. the privacy of others should not be publicized. the advantages or good deeds of praise of others are good deeds. when the other party hears your praise, it will definitely encourage good deeds. zhang yang's faults or disadvantages of others are to do evil. if criticism is too much, it will also recruit themselves. friends should have persuaded each other and build good moral cultivation together. if there are mistakes, you can't persuade each other, both of them will have defects.

[easy to solve] it is also human, good, evil and evil, and mental heights are uneven. there are many people affected by the vulgarity, and there are few people with kindness and generosity. if they are really benevolent, everyone naturally fears him, because he speaks fair and selflessly without concealment, and does not please others, so everyone will naturally be awesome. those who can get close to rende and learn from him are very lucky, because he will make our virtue progress every day, and the fault will decrease one day. if you are not willing to get close to the gentlemen of the people, there will be endless scourge, because the unscrupulous villain will approach us while it is false, and our words and deeds will be affected by bad words, and even the whole life will enter the wrong direction.

[easy to solve] the study should be sorted and cleaned, and the walls should be kept clean. when reading, stationery such as pen and ink, paper, and other stationery should be neat and messy, and all of them are in order to calm down to read. the ancients should use a brush to write ink first. if they were absent, the ink would be missed. if the words written are crooked, it means that you are impetuous and your heart cannot be determined. books should be divided into different categories, arranged neatly, placed in a fixed position, and they must be returned to the restore place after reading. although there is an urgent matter to leave, take the book and leave it before leaving. the book is the crystallization of wisdom. if there is a defect, it must be repaired and keeps complete. it is not a book that preach the words and deeds of sages and bad books that are harmful to physical and mental health. they should abandon and not read, so as not to be polluted, wisdom, and ambitions to become unhealthy. when you encounter difficulties or setbacks, don't abandon yourself, don't have to be cynical, complain about the world, you should be angry and study hard. although the realm of sages is high, it can be achieved in order. ❤

read thousands of times. it is self -explanatory.
implement life. it really does.

the disciples' name is ""xunmengwen"", which was made by li yuxiu, a talented talent in the kangxi period of the qing dynasty. its content adopts the sixth articles of ""the analects of confucius"": ""the disciples enter the filial piety, and they are brothers, and they believe in the people, and they love the public, and they have the power to learn."" sentence yiyun compilation is divided into five parts to perform; specifically listed on the etiquette and norms that the children are at home, out of the country, taking care of people, studying, and studying. later, after the revision of jia cunren in the qing dynasty, it was renamed ""disciples regulations"". it was the best reading of enlightenment and educating children dunlun to prevent evil and consciousness, and develop a loyal family style.
title: changli
1. family affairs, do not say to outsiders.
for example, if you talk about the economic situation at home, the place where your family usually goes out, or when the family is expected to go, in case of the thief or someone who is interested, they will break through the empty door and do bad things.
in addition, the ancients said that the family was ugly. if complains and accusing their families of listening to outsiders, others could not help you solve the problem. it would not only hurt the dignity of the family, but also made outsiders impress your family. or outsiders pass the housework you said as a gossip. if the sky is chaotic and then spread back to your ears, it will not only be unable to argue, but also increase the family's heart.

2. buddhism: knowing that more methods are actually giving.
❤ faiba: wisdom and wisdom.
i often read the ancient sage books and do their best. let the general public pay attention to moral cultivation and distinguish between right and wrong, so that they will not argue with others or sin.
❤ 富。。.
foreign wealth is something outside of the body, money, clothes, food, etc., provided to those in need.
inner wealth is his own body. at home, we help our family to do housework, serve our family with our bodies, and help the poor to help the poor disadvantage. this is all fortune. only can it be available.
❤ the fearless giving is the reason, the obtained fruit is healthy and longevity.
everything is terrifying, fearful, and threatened by life. you help him leave all horror and let him be physically and mentally stable. this is called fearless giving.

3. see the person who is lost, don't say proud.
(those who understand the feelings of others can always think about others.)
when he encounters frustrated, sad, and lost people, he has been hit in all aspects and is very unhappy. it should be said that he can comfort him, instead of saying how much he is.
when others break their fortunes and lose their jobs, you say that you are promoted to get rich, which will make the other party even more unbearable. pride and pride itself is evil, let alone hurt people?
on the contrary, the mood that can be eliminated by others' nervousness or anxiety is good. even if you ca n’t help you, do n’t go down. don't do it because of goodness, don't do it because of evil.
it is not only violence and crime called evil deeds. the evil thoughts that people often can't stop are the source of disaster.
welcome to print. bleak","弟子规（3）
❤泛爱众
凡是人。皆须爱。天同覆。
地同载。

【易解】 只要是人，就是同类，不分族群、人种、性别、宗教信仰，皆应相亲相爱。同是天地所化育覆载的，应该不分你我，互助合作，才能维持这个共生共荣的生命共同体。
❤
行高者。名自高。人所重。
非貌高。才大者。望自大。
人所服。非言大。
❤
【易解】 德行高尚者，名望自然高显，大家所敬重的是他的德行，不是外表容貌。有才能的人，处理事情的能力卓越，声望自然不凡，然而人们所欣赏佩服的，是他的处事能力，而不是因为他擅于夸耀。
❤
己有能。勿自私。人所能。
勿轻訾。勿谄富。勿骄贫。
勿厌故。勿喜新。人不闲。
勿事搅。人不安。勿话扰。

【易解】 当你有能力可以为众人服务的时候，不要自私自利，只考虑到自己，舍不得付出。对于他人的才华，应当学习、欣赏、赞叹，而不是批评、嫉妒、毁谤。不要去讨好巴结富有的人，也不要在穷人面前骄傲自大，或者轻视他们。更不可以喜新厌旧，对于老朋友或旧事物要珍惜，对于新朋友或新事物不要贪恋。当别人正在忙碌的时候，不要去打扰他，当别人心情不好或身心欠安的时候，不要闲言闲语去干扰他，增加他的烦恼与不安。
❤
人有短。切莫揭。人有私。
切莫说。道人善。即是善。
人知之。愈思勉。扬人恶。
即是恶。疾之甚。祸且作。
善相劝。德皆建。过不规。
道两亏。

【易解】 别人的缺点，不要去揭穿。别人的隐私，切忌去张扬。赞美他人的优点或善行，就是行善。当对方听到你的称赞之后，必定会更加勉励行善。张扬他人的过失或缺点，就是行恶，如果指责批评太过分了，还会给自己招来灾祸。朋友之间应该互相规过劝善，共同建立良好的品德修养。如果有错不能互相规劝，两个人的品德都会有缺陷。
❤
凡取与。贵分晓。与宜多。
取宜少。将加人。先问己。
己不欲。即速己。恩欲报。
怨欲忘。报怨短。报恩长。

【易解】 财物的取得或给予，一定要分办清楚明白，宁可多给别人，自己少拿一些，才能广结善缘，与人和睦相处。要将事物加到别人身上，或要托别人做事之前，先要反问自己：「如果换成是我，我愿意吗？」如果连自己都不愿意，就要立刻停止。受人恩惠要记得报答。别人有对不起自己的事，应该宽大为怀把它忘掉。怨恨不平的事不要记在心中太久，过去就算了。别人对我们的恩德，则要铭记在心，感恩不忘，常思报答。
❤
待婢仆。身贵端。虽贵端。
慈而宽。势服人。心不然。
理服人。方无言。

【易解】 对待家中的婢女与仆人，要注重自己的品行端正并以身作则。虽然品行端正很重要，但是仁慈宽大更可贵。如果仗势强逼别人服从，对方难免口服心不服。唯有以理服人，别人才会心悦诚服没有怨言。

同是人。类不齐。流俗众。
仁者希。果仁者。人多畏。
言不讳。色不媚。能亲仁。
无限好。德日进。过日少。
不亲仁。无限害。小人进。
百事坏。

【易解】 同样是人，善恶邪正、心智高低却是良莠不齐。受风气流俗影响的人多，仁慈宽厚的人少。如果是真正有仁德的人，大家自然敬畏他，因为他说话公正无私没有隐瞒，又不讨好他人，所以大家自然会起敬畏之心。能够亲近仁德的人，向他学习，是很幸运的事，因为他会使我们的德行一天比一天进步，过错也跟着一天天减少。如果不肯亲近仁人君子，就会有无穷的祸害，因为不肖的小人会趁虚来接近我们，日积月累，我们的言行思想都会受到不良的影响，甚至使整个人生走入错误的方向。


不力行。但学文。长浮华。
成何人。但力行。不学文。
任己见。昧理真。

【易解】 不能身体力行孝、悌、谨、信、泛爱众、亲仁这些本分，一味死读书，纵然有些知识，也只是增长自己浮华不实的习气，变成一个不切实际的人，如此读书又有何用？如果只是谨守教诲，却不肯读书学习，就容易因不明事理，而依自己的偏见行事，造成错误而不自知，这也是不对的。

读书法。有三到。心眼口。
信皆要。方读此。勿慕彼。
此未终。彼勿起。宽为限。
紧用功。工夫到。滞塞通。
心有疑。随札记。就人问。
求确义。

【易解】 读书的方法要注重三到：眼到、口到、心到，三者缺一不可，如此方能收到事半功倍的效果。研究学问要专一、专精才能深入，不能这本书才开始读没多久，又欣羡其他的书，想看其他的书，这样永远也定不下心把一本书好好深入读通。必须把这本书读完，才能再读另外一本。在订定读书计画的时候，不妨宽松一些，实际执行时，就要加紧用功，严格执行，不可以懈怠偷懒。日积月累功夫深了，原先窒碍不通、困顿疑惑之处，自然而然都迎刃而解了。求学当中，心里有疑问时，应随时笔记，一有机会，就向良师益友请教，务必确实明白它的真义。

房室清。墙壁净。几案洁。
笔砚正。墨磨偏。心不端。
字不敬。心先病。列典籍。
有定处。读看毕。还原处。
虽有急。卷束齐。有缺坏。
就补之。非圣书。屏勿视。
蔽聪明。坏心志。勿自暴。
勿自弃。圣与贤。可驯致。

【易解】 书房要整理清洁，墙壁要保持干净。读书时，书桌上笔墨纸砚等文具要摆放整齐不凌乱，触目所及皆是井然有条，才能静下心来读书。古人写字使用毛笔先要磨墨，如果心不在焉，墨就会磨偏了。写出来的字如果歪歪斜斜，就表示你浮躁不安，心定不下来。书本应该分门别类，排列整齐，放在固定的位置，阅读完毕须归还原处。虽有急事要离开，也要把书本收好再离开。书本是智慧的结晶，有缺损就要修补，保持完整。不是传述圣贤言行的著作，以及有害身心健康的不良书刊，都应该摒弃不看，以免身心受到污染、智慧遭受蒙蔽、心志变得不健康。遇到困难或挫折的时候，不要自暴自弃，也不必愤世嫉俗、怨天尤人，应该发愤向上努力学习。圣贤境界虽高，循序渐进，也是可以达到的。 ❤

弟子规易解（终）
书名：弟子规 三字经 
孝经 易解。欢迎翻印。
❤明伦教孝
读书千遍。其意自现。
落实生活。确实做到。

弟子规原名＜训蒙文＞，为清朝康熙年间秀才李毓秀所作。其内容采用《论语》学而篇第六条：「弟子入则孝，出则弟，谨而信，泛爱众，而亲仁，行有余力，则以学文。」的文义以三字一句，两句一韵编纂而成，分为五个部份加以演述；具体列举出为人子弟在家、出外、待人接物、求学应有的礼仪与规范，特别讲求家庭教育与生活教育。后经清朝贾存仁修订改编，并改名为＜弟子规＞，是启蒙养正，教育子弟敦伦尽份防邪存诚，养成忠厚家风的最佳读物。
书名：常礼举要
1.家庭之事，不可向外人言。
举例来说，如果你讲到家里的经济状况、家人平常出入的地点，或是什么时间家人预计要去哪里，万一被小偷或是有心人士打听到了，他们会闯空门、做坏事。
另外，古人说家丑不可外扬，若是抱怨、指责家人给外人听，别人也不能帮你解决问题，不仅会伤害家人的尊严，也让让外人对你们一家印象不佳。又或者外人把你说的家务事都当成闲谈八卦传出去，若是说得天花乱坠再传回你耳中，不仅百口莫辩，也徒增一家人心里难受。

2.佛教：知道得到更多的方法其实是布施。
❤法布施：得聪明智慧。
常常读古圣贤书，并身体力行。让社会大众能够注重品德修养，能够分辨是非，才不会与人争执或是犯罪。
❤财布施得财富、功德。
外财就是身外之物，钱、衣服、食物等，提供给需要的人。
内财是自己身体。我们在家里面，帮助家人做家事，用我们的身体为家人服务，在外做义工帮助贫困弱势这都是财布施。能舍才有得。
❤无畏布施是因，得到的果报是健康长寿。
万物有恐怖、有畏惧、生命受到威胁，你帮助他离开一切恐怖，让他身心安稳，这叫无畏布施。

3.见失意人，不说得意语。
（明白别人感受的人总是能够多为别人着想呢。）
遇到失意、伤心、失落的人，他各方面都受到打击，很不得意，应该说点让他得到安慰的话，而不是说自己有多在行、多厉害。
当别人破了财，丢了工作，你却说自己升官发财，这会让对方更加不堪忍受。傲慢、骄傲本身即是恶，更何况用来伤人？
相反的，能够免除别人紧张恐惧或是忧虑的心情即是善，即便帮不上忙也千万不要落井下石。勿因善小而不为，勿因恶小而为之。
并非只有暴力、犯罪才叫恶行，人常常止不住的恶念也是灾难的源头。

bleak","观世音菩萨【大悲水之念服法】
凡三宝弟子净口虔修者均可念大悲水疗疾，并布施结缘。念时，先须焚香顶礼，供开水一杯（多少不拘）；应念：1.香赞；2.净口业真言；3.南无大慈大悲救苦救难广大灵感观世音菩萨；4.千手千眼无碍大悲心陀罗尼（三声），大悲咒（四十九遍）；5.补阙真言；6.南无大悲观世音菩萨（十声）。此大悲水仗佛威力能治一切大小疑难之症。服此水者必须素口先念「南无大悲观世音菩萨」十声（如小儿或病者无法念时，凡有关系之人均可同声代念），然后服下，立刻见效。如服此水者或其家人能发愿放生，或每月斋素几日，尤见功效；至若潜修大德念大悲水时，水可无限而布施亦无限，此随发心者功德如何而定。
【大悲咒防火灾法】
除用大悲水遍洒居屋可免火灾外，可改备黄元纸一张，念咒时仪式同上述；每念大悲咒一遍于此黄纸上印一红。共念大悲咒四十九遍（即印七O成一行，共七行），并于四角O上，每角加念观音灵感真言（即十小咒之一）一遍，加一小咒于角上大O内，然后将此咒纸焚于各家灶君座前，能免一宅火灾。如念咒者功德圆满，能使四周邻舍同受法益，不遭回禄。
【观音灵感真言】
唵。嘛呢叭弥吽。麻曷倪牙纳。积都特巴达。积特些纳。微达哩葛。萨而斡而塔。卜哩悉塔葛。纳补啰纳。纳卜哩。丢忒班纳。
（口奈）麻嚧吉。说啰耶。莎诃。
【炉香赞】
炉香乍爇。法界蒙薰。诸佛海会。悉遥闻。随处结祥云。诚意方殷。诸佛现全身。南无香云盖菩萨摩诃萨（三称）
【净口业真言】
唵。修利修利。摩诃修利。修修利。娑婆訶。
【补阙真言】
南谟喝囉怛那哆囉夜耶。佉啰佉啰。俱住俱住。摩啰摩啰。虎罗。吽。贺贺。苏怛拿。吽。泼抹拿。娑婆訶。 （三遍）
书名：楞严咒·大悲咒·十小咒·心经神咒功德说明·放生仪轨。
【诵持大悲咒之功效】
一、1.能得安乐。 2.除一切病。 3.延年益寿。 4.得富饶。 5.灭除一切恶业重罪。 6.离障难。 7.增长一切白法诸功德。 8.成就一切诸善根。 9.远离一切诸怖畏。 10.临命终时，任何佛土，随愿得生。
二、观世音复白佛言：持此咒者，得十五种善生：1.所生之处常逢善王。 2.常生善国。 3.常值好时。 4.常逢善友。 5.身根常得具足。 6.道心纯熟。 7.不犯禁戒。 8.所有眷属，恩义和顺。 9.资具财食，常得丰足。 10.恒得他人恭敬扶接。 11.所有财宝，无他劫夺。 12.意欲所求，皆悉称遂。 13.龙天善神恒常拥卫。 14.所生之处，见佛闻法。 15所闻正法，悟甚深义。
不受十五种恶死：
1.不为饥饿困苦死。 2.不为枷禁扙楚死。 3.不为冤家仇怼死。 4.不为军阵相杀死。 5.不为虎狼恶兽残害死。 6.不为毒蛇虺蝎所中死。 7.不为水火焚漂死。 8.不为毒药所中死。 9.不为蛊毒害死。 10.不为狂乱失念死。 11.不为山树崖岸坠落死。 12.不为恶人魇魅死。 13.不为邪神恶鬼得便死。 14.不为恶病缠身死。 15.不为非分自害死。
三、诵持此咒者，世间八万四千种病，悉皆治之。
四、若在山野诵经坐禅，如有山精魍魉鬼神扰乱，诵此咒一遍，诸鬼魔皆被缚。
五、如法诵持者，观世音时敕一切善神、金刚密迹，常遂护卫，不离侧，如护眼命。
六、若诸众生现世求愿者，于三七日净持斋戒，诵此陀罗尼，必果所愿。

after exiting this video yesterday, i immediately saw a video that introduced her rise. i went to see it.
at the beginning, it was the beginning of the food. i found her earliest video. the cooking method was skilled, the color and fragrance were great, and the splicing was relatively coherent. very normal. there are no fairy -fluttering people in the picture. it is a very normal video.
later, began to be excavated, and the consortium began to fund her and provides professional editing. at this time, the style of painting began to change and became a question i asked in the previous message.
in fact, the content she produced is more suitable for one hour.
each process of picking, finishing, and production is displayed at least five minutes, and the video content may not be so messy.
other bloggers may be divided into four or five issues, and finally together becomes an ending.
thinking above.","谢谢说明
昨天退出这个视频之后，立刻看到了一个介绍她崛起过程的视频，我去看了一下。
一开始的确是美食开始，我找了她最早期的视频，做菜手法娴熟，色香味也棒，剪接也比较连贯，不会东一个画面西一个画面。很正常。画面里面也不太出现仙气飘飘的人。是一个很正常的视频。
到了后来，开始被发掘，财团开始资助她并且提供专业的剪辑，这个时候画风开始转变，变成我上一个留言所询问的问题。
其实以她所产制的内容，比较适合一个钟的内容。
把采摘，整理，制作的每一个过程至少用五分钟展示，可能视频内容不会这么凌乱。
其他的博主可能这么多内容是分成四五期展示，最后合起来成为一个收尾。

5981,UgxvAuJTFlMG5TuJm3F4AaABAg,0,"if you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about liziqi ( li ziyi ): 

in 1990, li ziyi fell to the ground in mianyang, sichuan. her parents divorced when she was very young. later, her father died, and li ziyi became an orphan. his stepmother didnโ€t treat her well. li zizhen mentioned on weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten. 

grandpa and grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take li ziyu home and live. when li ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. at the age of 14, li ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. her first life was very hard. she slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months. 

li ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. in order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. later, when talking about the matter, li zizhen frankly said: โ€i didnโ€t say that i liked music at that time, just to live, i felt that it was well paid.โ€ 

in 2012, because grandma was ill once, li ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. โ€being closer, i feel more at ease.โ€ 

after returning, li ziyi opened a taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. in 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, li ziyi was exposed to the short video platform meipai. until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of taobao business, li ziyi re-entered meipai to prepare for his own video program. 

the reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment. 

in an interview with the living room of sina club, li ziyi mentioned, โ€all these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. in the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places. 

in the beginning, li ziyi gave himself a topic called โ€four seasons change, eat while you eatโ€. after the suggestion of meipai editor, it became โ€ancient foodโ€ and it is still used today. 

in september 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for li ziyu to get more attention in the future. sina weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support. 

as mentioned at the beginning of the article, liu tongming brought her weibo resources support. 

one day in september 2016, li feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private weibo message from โ€mr. lโ€. mr. l expressed his love for li ziyuโ€s video content, felt that he had fulfilled his taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her. 

for a long time after that, li ziyi received mr. lโ€s private letter. โ€it would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. this is uschinaโ€s proud traditional culture should be seen by people in china and around the world. โ€mr. l said in a private message. 

at first, after seeing these private messages, li ziyi didnโ€t care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. until one day, mr. l came to the city where li zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. mr. lโ€s politeness and clear logical thinking made li slowly drop his initial alert. 

this accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of li zizhen. not long after the meal was over, with the help of mr. l, li zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on sina weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing li zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head. 

this experience is partly recorded in a diary of li zizheng that year. some insiders close to the senior executives of weinian technology confirmed to tencentโ€s โ€shenwangโ€ that the โ€mr. lโ€ is actually liu tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. daxiong liu, the founder of wei nian technology, an mcn company to which li zizhen now belongs. 

on december 8th, the reading volume of a weibo topic labeled โ€is li ziyi a cultural outputโ€ climbed to 800 million. li zizheng was once again on the hot search list. 

the video created by li ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now. 

extensive overseas communication is an important reason for li zihuanโ€s renewed attention. some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional chinese culture and cuisine. others think that her video is not completely true to reflect chinaโ€s rural life. 

even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a dj, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life itโ€s still just a fiction for character setting. 

an insider of weinian technology told tencentโ€s โ€deep webโ€ that li ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by li ziyi himself. the popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. in fact, both li zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs. 

until august 17, 2018, li ziyiโ€s eponymous tmall store officially opened. six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. a year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the li zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million. 
the value behind li ziyiโ€s ip is being quickly tapped. 

li ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. but now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements.

source: https://www.ww01.net/en/archives/33757","如果您在这里是新手，那么这绝对是您需要了解的有关Liziqi（Li Ziyi）的一切：

1990年，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）跌倒在四川米扬（Mianyang）。她的父母很小的时候就离婚了。后来，她的父亲去世了，李齐伊成为孤儿。他的继母对她不好。李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）在微博上提到，当他的继母将头发拖入排水沟并被殴打时，他有半死的经历。

爷爷和奶奶使孙女感到沮丧，最后决定带李Ziyu回家。当李齐伊（Li Ziyi）五年级时，他的祖父再次去世，他的祖母很难抚养她继续上学。李齐（Li Ziyi）在14岁时不得不辍学，独自去城市努力工作，并开始了八年的流浪生活。她的第一人生非常艰难。她睡在公园椅上，挠头两个月。

Li Ziyi还曾在酒店担任服务生，每月薪水为300元。为了赚取更多的收入，她去学习演奏唱片并在酒吧里唱歌。后来，在谈论此事时，李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）坦率地说：“我不是说当时我喜欢音乐，只是为了生活，我觉得这是付出的。”

2012年，由于奶奶曾经生病，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）担心她后来会后悔，扔掉所有工作并返回奶奶。 “靠近，我感到更加放松。”

返回后，李Ziyi开了一家淘宝商店，但业务一直在运行，他几乎没有吃饭。 2015年，在他的弟弟的影响下，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）接触了短视频平台Meipai。直到2016年，看到他的弟弟在Meipai上有一些粉丝，并且拥有更多的粉丝可以改善淘宝业务的心态，Li Ziyi重新进入Meipai，为自己的视频节目做准备。

她之所以选择以这种风格拍摄视频与她的童年环境密切相关的原因。

李·齐（Li Ziyi）在接受西那俱乐部（Nina Club）的客厅采访时说：“所有这些在农村自给自足的事情，对我来说，它们嫉妒。在简短的视频中，她选择从最熟悉的地方开始。

一开始，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）称自己为“四个季节变化，吃饭时吃饭”。在Meipai编辑的建议之后，它变成了“古老的食物”，并且今天仍然使用。

2016年9月，一个新的机会悄悄地出现了，这也成为李Zyu将来更加关注的重要推动者。 Sina Weibo开始公开寻找更多出色的简短视频创建者以获得资源支持。

正如文章开头所述，刘·汤明（Liu Tongming）为她带来了微博的资源支持。

2016年9月的一天，古老的简短视频博客作者Li Feng意外收到了“先生先生的私人微博消息”。 L”。 L先生表达了对李Ziyu的视频内容的热爱，觉得他已经实现了他的作陶王的梦，并希望与她见面。

此后很长一段时间，Li Ziyi收到了L先生的私人信。 “这样一个好视频让这个人看到它是可惜的。这是中国和世界各地的人们应该看到USCHINA骄傲的传统文化。 “先生。我在一条私人消息中说。

起初，在看到这些私人消息后，李Ziyi并不在乎太多，甚至不必担心遇到骗子。直到一天，L先生来到了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）所在的城市，并想请她吃饭和聊天。 L先生的礼貌和清晰的逻辑思维使李慢慢地放弃了最初的警报。

这次偶然的会议彻底改变了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）的生活轨迹。用餐结束后不久，在L先生的帮助下，李·Zizheng（Li Zizheng）得到了Sina Weibo的大量资源的支持，加快了她的知名度，并允许Li Zizhen赶到头部网络影响者的排队。

这种经历部分记录在那年的李Zizheng日记中。一些与温尼安技术高级管理人员接近的内部人士证实了腾讯的“申旺”，即“先生先生L”实际上是刘·汤明（Liu Tongming），他的化名是公开报道的。 Wei Nian Technology的创始人Daxiong Liu是Li Zizhen现在属于的MCN公司。

12月8日，一个标有“是文化产出”的微博主题的阅读量攀升至8亿。李Zizheng再次在热门搜索列表中。

Li Ziyi和她创建的视频现在已成为一个值得研究的现象。

广泛的海外沟通是李齐伊安（Li Zihuan）重新关注的重要原因。有人说她已经拍摄了理想的乡村生活，并传播了中国传统文化和美食的魅力。其他人则认为她的视频并非完全正确地反映中国的乡村生活。

自从爆炸再次提出以来一直很受欢迎的疑问，例如成为DJ，成为富人的第二代，无论是我自己的视频，是否有强烈的推动力，视频是真的对于农村生活，这仍然是角色环境的小说。

Weinian Technology的一位内部人士告诉Tencent的“ Deep Web”，Li Ziyi是普通的，相关的视频内容是由Li Ziyi本人制作的。受欢迎程度不是公司和他本人的倡议。实际上，他背后的李·齐伊安（Li Zihuan）和微读团队都非常低调，他们非常热情，拒绝了当前的所有采访需求。

直到2018年8月17日，Li Ziyi的同名TMALL商店正式开业。上网六天后，当时只有五种产品的商店的销售额超过150,000，销售额超过1000万。一年后，李Zizhen旗舰店展示的21种产品的总销售额超过130万，总销售额达到7100万。
Li Ziyi的IP背后的价值正在迅速挖掘。

Li Ziyi从头开始，并以自己的力量获得了第一批粉丝。但是现在，声名和财富的受欢迎程度和收益显然不再只是她的成就。
根据Tianyan Search的说法，“ Deep Web”表明，Li Ziyi属于的McN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。于2013年2月28日成立，其注册资本为5.208亿元。根据引言，Wei Nian是一家娱乐娱乐公司，通过简短的视频将KOL孵化为IP，并扩展到消费者品牌。

Qixinbao的信息表明，商标“ Li Zihuan”有100多种知识产权信息。申请人公司是Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。产品类别包括食品，服装，鞋子和帽子，染料和脂肪，染料和脂肪，啤酒和饮料，金融物业管理，餐饮和住宿。

不仅如此，Wei Nian还与Li Ziyu的公司建立了不可忽视的联系。

根据眼睛检查，李亚吉亚（应该是李祖的原始名称）于2017年7月20日成立了四川Ziyu文化传播公司有限公司。主管Li Jiajia持有49％的股份。

根据其他数据，Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。的背后有多达50家受益公司，包括Greenland Holdings，ZTE，新华社媒体，Vanke，Light Media等。
在Weinian技术的股东中，Sina Weibo特别引人注目。

从Wei Nian Technology到Sina Weibo，Li Ziyi逐渐拥有互联网名人期待的最佳卡片。
用她自己的话说，她从“有点透明变成了一个对社会无用的人”。在进入公众观点并被更多人注意到之后，李齐的责任感也变得更加重。
“我想尽我所能，做更多对社会有益的事情，例如传统文化，非遗产文化工匠的传播，我想向所有人展示这些旧事物，以便更多的人知道。李Ziyi说。

so i wouldn't say that someday a random person decided that ""oh that frog looks delicius"", but rather ""i have a family to feed, and frogs are everywhere around here. let's see if i can do something with them.""","我认为，在大多数情况下，“绝望的时期要求采取绝望的措施”是非常真实的。请记住，大多数传统食物（不仅是中国食品）通常是由po肉吃的所有盘子制成的。过去，穷人不得不尝试以自己的身份生存，因此他们会尝试吃任何可食用的东西。
因此，我不会说有一天一个随机的人决定“哦，那只青蛙看起来很熟食”，而是“我有一个家庭要喂食，而青蛙到处都是。让我们看看我是否可以对它们做某事。”"
