15132,UgyDd785tYvpzokfbIt4AaABAg,0,3 years ago,"8.16 million subscribers. i wonder how much she makes from youtube alone each month. she probable could hire a team of more than a dozen farmers to help. based on the amount of veggies growing in her garden/farm, she would need more than ten farmers. add to that other labor intensive work (based on the other videos), such as raising lamb for wool, harvesting the wool and cleaning/dyeing/spinning the wool which she used to knit a huge winter coat. i know i won't be able to do all those without help. while i enjoyed the videos and admire her capabilities, i enjoy my simple life without having to toil like her. another note: unless she is selling them, why does she cook so much food? harvest so much veggies put into jars to ferment - that would last her ten years of fermented veggies, etc., etc. overall, one needs more than the knowledge of ten phd's to do all what she is doing in these videos. congratulations to her, super woman/girl. for city girls, don't dream of living like her, just not practical or possible. enjoy your city life.",816万用户。我想知道她每个月独自从YouTube中赚多少钱。她可能会雇用一个由十几个农民组成的团队来提供帮助。根据在她的花园/农场种植的蔬菜数量，她需要十多名农民。再加上其他劳动密集型工作（基于其他视频），例如抬起羊毛的羔羊，收获羊毛，清洁/染色/旋转羊毛，她用来编织一件巨大的冬衣。我知道我将无需帮助。当我喜欢这些视频并欣赏她的能力时，我享受了简单的生活，而不必像她一样辛苦工作。另一个注意：除非她要出售它们，否则她为什么要煮这么多食物？收获太多的蔬菜将罐子放入发酵中 - 这将持续她十年的发酵蔬菜等。总的来说，一个人比十个博士学位的知识更需要做她在这些视频中所做的一切。恭喜她，超级女人/女孩。对于城市女孩来说，不要梦想像她一样生活，只是不切实际或可能。享受你的城市生活。
