it is mind-boggling how so many have decided to air grievances because of this video, which shows how these people gather and prepare foods, which cost a pretty penny in health food stores.

no one asked them nor expects them to give up their high mortgages and credit card debts.
it is some other ones lifestyle, not for all, but nevertheless, an excellent one.

令人难以置信的是，由于这段视频，有多少人决定宣布申诉，这显示了这些人如何收集和准备食物，这在健康食品商店中花费了一分钱。
那些来回扔飞镖的人要么必须支付自然营养食品的高昂费用，要么必须“垃圾”。
没有人要求他们也没有期望他们放弃他们的高抵押贷款和信用卡债务。
它是其他一些生活方式，不是所有的生活方式，但仍然是一种出色的生活方式。
（我认为这是糖或水中的某些愤怒。）
我今年70岁，住在不太农村地区，而是远离我家乡的小镇。
最后，我正在种植食物，比Stevie更“高兴”，因为这是一次真正可爱的经历，经过多年的企业世界。
我从来没有想要它，但是我母亲给我留下了深刻的印象，那就是上学，得到一份好工作，希望退休金是必要的。
不！
我想画，素描，绘画，设计！
我做了一些，并习惯了一生。
