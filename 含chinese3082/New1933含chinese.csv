22055,Ugxlko-aCv8bm3F_QJp4AaABAg,5,"recently, li ziyi has been the ""ambassador to the promotional ambassador of the rural rural rural rural rich"", which has triggered a new round of comment boom. after seeing some, i couldn't help but feel like i could provide different perspectives.

the point is, i hope that everyone is calm, discuss things, and try to listen to it as much as possible.

don't bully a diligent, brave and intelligent girl.

according to the good cat catching the mouse, li ziyi is not an outstanding good cat. not to mention the renminbi income, she made a lot of money on the international stage, about tens of thousands of dollars a day, envy everyone, realize her dream of serving her grandmother's life, and obtaining the harvest of no dare to expect. impressive.

nearly 8 million foreign fans, everyone shows the truth, kindness showing the video. unconvinced? if you try it, you will know. jiang feng, the most popular self -media chinese, has subscribed for 280,000, is already an example for many people. it's just 3%of this little girl.

the videos of overseas cattle guo wengui are only watched tens of thousands of people every time. li ziyi's video is five or six million. the best 30 million. the video three years ago was searched every day, and the number of clicks continued to skyrocket.

this is not a general miracle.

i spent the strength of nine niu and tiger to make a video. so far, i only have 160 subscriptions, and the best video is watching more than 1,000 people.

i know li ziyi's weight. everyone also weighs.

everyone has the most discussions. the most misunderstanding of li ziyi is that she is just an actor, and her work is made by a huge team.

please understand her development history a little.

li ziyi had a childhood young man who had been unable to look back, had various workers, and had a long period of time for a person's exploration of experiments. he finally rely on his talents, hard work, hard work, and succeed.

the current situation, i am afraid that zhang yimou is likely to be a director. of course, li ziyi does not need zhang yimou. i have an analogy. li ziyi has no self -learning talent, and the artistic talent shown is no worse than zhang yimou.

li ziyi rely on his own efforts to come to this day. you open your eyes and talk nonsense, and you are unwilling to do basic investigations and research. he maliciously pour dirty girls to a hard -working girl.

really blushing for you. be kind. do nโ€t be so rude and hateful.

true: li ziyi's true, not that she is too beautiful, not what kind of shoes are wearing in the farmland. in my eyes, li zizhen's true, manifested in her hard work, hard work, and manifested in her soul. nothing will do.

of course, she will not seriously and deliberately express the hardships of the peasants in sichuan and the sufferings of rural poor today. li ziyi is pursuing the amount of subscriptions and click volume. her performance is basically impeccable.

li ziyi truly shows her own pursuit of life and her own state of life.

of course, try your best to beautify. otherwise, where can i subscribe?

good: see her depending on the grandmother's life, and take care of each other. thinking that grandma finally got a good life, she was really happy.

thinking of my work hard for a whole life. li ziyi's kindness is one of the biggest highlights of the video.

beauty: needless to say. i admire me and admire from the bottom of my heart. some people will say, team teams, foreign announcements and so on.

you just need to see li ziyi's earliest video to feel her artistic talent.

besides: with the current situation of li ziyi's current daily gold, let alone the government, any of the people with funds will not hesitate to make a behind -the -scenes team.

dawai xuan:

where is this? what big publicity? what a crime is to have no words. a girl mixed with meals, accidentally red and purple, do nโ€t tm โ€s blind eyes?

but here to tell the government and the communist youth league, do not speculate. stir good things. what is the blind ginseng?

the government was not stupid, and i saw li ziyi's success and wanted to use it. in fact, maybe good intentions have become bad things. with my concept, the government, the communist youth league, the best leave her alone. it is not as good as the last four, truth, goodness and beauty.

ziyi, please be careful. no need to cooperate too deeply with the government. tell them to let you develop freely in accordance with their greatest interests. otherwise, the end may not be good for anyone.

cut!

during the seven years of labor in rural areas during the revolution, the hardships of the rural areas of china's rural areas know a little.

the reason why li ziyi feels is because most of the farm work that li ziyi has done has done it, and i will even accept the soles of the shoe. i rushed the cow to rake the ground in the paddy field, and i tried it. if you can't try it, you have to give it to the poor farmers around him. very difficult work. i did not dry the back of the mountain from the mountain. there are no bamboo or mountains there. almost all of the others can't be familiar. rice, wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, pigs and sheep beef, planting vegetables. we do not plant fruit trees. moving the bricks by myself and moving the bricks. at the age of seventeen, he was cooking for fifteen students.

li ziyi used bamboo to make a sofa for me too much. too admire!

ziyi, refueling ๅฟ…๏ธ do not worry about it. take your own way and let others have a way. don't ignore some people's words of talking nonsense.

ps

ziyi does not necessarily know the history of 12 million people starved in sichuan during the great famine. mianyang is the hardest hit area. please know. it is important to your future development.","最近李子柒担任“中国农村青年致富带头人推广大使”，引发新一轮评论热潮。看了一些，忍俊不禁，有感而发，希望能够提供不同视角。

关键是，希望大家平心静气，就事论事，尽量做到兼听则明。

不要语言欺凌一个勤劳勇敢聪慧的女孩子。

按照逮着老鼠就是好猫的说法，李子柒不啻是一只杰出的极其优秀的好猫。不说人民币收入，她大把大把的在国际舞台上赚美元，大概每天几万美元吧，羡煞众人，实现自己养家糊口侍奉奶奶的人生梦想，获得原本不敢奢望的收获，可喜可贺令人钦佩。

将近800万外国粉丝，大家是冲着视频展现的真善美来的。不服气？你试试就知道了。海外最红的自媒体华人江峰，28万订阅，已经是很多人崇拜的榜样。仅仅是这小姑娘的3%。

海外牛人郭文贵每次的视频也只是几万人看。李子柒的视频动辄五六百万。最好的3千万。三年前的视频还在被人每天搜索，点击量继续暴涨。

这可不是一般的奇迹。

我费了九牛二虎之力做视频，至今只有160订阅量，最好的一个视频1000多人观看。

我知道李子柒的分量。大家也掂量掂量。

大家议论最多，对李子柒误解最大的是，她不过是个演员，工作都是一个庞大的团队做的。

请稍微了解一下她的发展史。

李子柒有过不堪回首的童年少年，有过各种打工经验，有过很长时间一个人摸索实验失败，最后靠自己的才华，勤奋，努力，获得了成功。

现在状况，恐怕邀请张艺谋来做导演都有可能。当然李子柒不需要张艺谋我是打个比方。李子柒无师自通自学成才，表现出来的艺术天分，不比张艺谋差一丝一毫。

李子柒完全靠自己的努力走到今天。你们睁着眼睛瞎说八道，连基本的调查研究都不愿意做，恶意向一个勤劳致富的女孩子泼脏水。

真替你们脸红。Be kind. Don’t be so rude and hateful.

真：李子柒的真，不是表现在她穿着过于漂亮，不是表演在穿着什么样的鞋子在农田里劳作。在我的目光里，李子柒的真，表现在她的勤劳，吃苦耐劳，表现在她的心灵手巧。啥都会干。

她当然不会去认真刻意的表现四川绵阳农民的辛苦和今日农村贫困人群的苦难。李子柒追求的是订阅量，点击量。她的表现基本无懈可击。

李子柒真实的表现了她自己对生活的追求，她自己的生活状态。

当然要尽力美化。不然哪里来订阅量？

善：看她和奶奶相依为命，互相关照。想到奶奶终于过上好日子真为子柒高兴。

想起自己姥姥勤劳一生。李子柒的善良，是视频最大亮点之一。

美：毋庸赘言。令我感佩，从心底里佩服。有人又会说了，团队团队，大外宣等等。

你只需要去看看李子柒最早的视频就能感觉到她的艺术天分。

再说一遍：以李子柒目前日进斗金的状况，别说政府，任何一个有资金的人都会毫不犹豫甘作幕后团队。

大外宣：

这哪儿跟哪儿啊？什么大外宣？真是欲加之罪 何患无辞。一个女孩子混口饭吃，不小心大红大紫，别TM的瞎着眼胡说八道好不好？

但是此处敬告政府和共青团，别投机不成舍把米。把好事搅合了。瞎参和什么呢？

政府不傻，看到李子柒的成功趁机想利用起来。其实也许好心办成坏事儿。以我的观念，政府啊共青团啊什么的最好leave her alone. 免得最后四不像，真善美不在。

子柒也请慎重。不必和政府合作太深。告诉他们让你自由发展符合他们的最大利益。不然最后也许结局对谁都不好。

切切！

在下文革时期在农村劳动七年多，对中国农村的苦难农民的艰辛略知一二。

之所以感觉李子柒的真实，就是因为李子柒干过的农活儿大部分我都干过，我甚至会纳鞋底。赶着牛在水田里耙地，我试过。怎么试都不行只好交给身边的贫农代表。很不容易的活计。从山上砍竹子背下山没有干过。我们那里没有竹子也没有山。其它几乎都再熟悉不过。水稻，小麦，玉米，红薯，养猪羊牛，种菜。我们没有种水果树。自己盖房子搬砖头用手推车运转头。十七岁当炊事员专职为十五个同学做饭。

李子柒用竹子做沙发让我太佩服了。太佩服！

子柒，加油

PS

子柒不一定知道大饥荒时期四川饿死1200万人的历史。绵阳是重灾区。请一定了解一下。对你今后发展至关重要。"

10991,UgzVXwN2Sk-mZ8X4ecJ4AaABAg,5,"if you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about liziqi ( li ziyi ): 

in 1990, li ziyi fell to the ground in mianyang, sichuan. her parents divorced when she was very young. later, her father died, and li ziyi became an orphan. his stepmother didnโ€t treat her well. li zizhen mentioned on weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten. 

grandpa and grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take li ziyu home and live. when li ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. at the age of 14, li ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. her first life was very hard. she slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months. 

li ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. in order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. later, when talking about the matter, li zizhen frankly said: โ€i didnโ€t say that i liked music at that time, just to live, i felt that it was well paid.โ€ 

in 2012, because grandma was ill once, li ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. โ€being closer, i feel more at ease.โ€ 

after returning, li ziyi opened a taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. in 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, li ziyi was exposed to the short video platform meipai. until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of taobao business, li ziyi re-entered meipai to prepare for his own video program. 

the reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment. 

in an interview with the living room of sina club, li ziyi mentioned, โ€all these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. in the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places. 

in the beginning, li ziyi gave himself a topic called โ€four seasons change, eat while you eatโ€. after the suggestion of meipai editor, it became โ€ancient foodโ€ and it is still used today. 

in september 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for li ziyu to get more attention in the future. sina weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support. 

as mentioned at the beginning of the article, liu tongming brought her weibo resources support. 

one day in september 2016, li feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private weibo message from โ€mr. lโ€. mr. l expressed his love for li ziyuโ€s video content, felt that he had fulfilled his taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her. 

for a long time after that, li ziyi received mr. lโ€s private letter. โ€it would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. this is uschinaโ€s proud traditional culture should be seen by people in china and around the world. โ€mr. l said in a private message. 

at first, after seeing these private messages, li ziyi didnโ€t care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. until one day, mr. l came to the city where li zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. mr. lโ€s politeness and clear logical thinking made li slowly drop his initial alert. 

this accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of li zizhen. not long after the meal was over, with the help of mr. l, li zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on sina weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing li zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head. 

this experience is partly recorded in a diary of li zizheng that year. some insiders close to the senior executives of weinian technology confirmed to tencentโ€s โ€shenwangโ€ that the โ€mr. lโ€ is actually liu tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. daxiong liu, the founder of wei nian technology, an mcn company to which li zizhen now belongs. 

on december 8th, the reading volume of a weibo topic labeled โ€is li ziyi a cultural outputโ€ climbed to 800 million. li zizheng was once again on the hot search list. 

the video created by li ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now. 

extensive overseas communication is an important reason for li zihuanโ€s renewed attention. some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional chinese culture and cuisine. others think that her video is not completely true to reflect chinaโ€s rural life. 

even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a dj, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life itโ€s still just a fiction for character setting. 

an insider of weinian technology told tencentโ€s โ€deep webโ€ that li ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by li ziyi himself. the popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. in fact, both li zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs. 

until august 17, 2018, li ziyiโ€s eponymous tmall store officially opened. six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. a year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the li zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million. 
the value behind li ziyiโ€s ip is being quickly tapped. 

li ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. but now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements. 
according to tianyan search, โ€deep webโ€ shows that mcn hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd., which li ziyi belongs to, was established on february 28, 2013, with a registered capital of rmb 5.208 million. according to the introduction, wei nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates kol into ip through short videos and extends to consumer brands. 

the information of qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark โ€li zihuanโ€. the applicant companies are hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd. the product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, financial property management, catering and accommodation. 

not only that, wei nian also has inextricable links with li ziyuโ€s companies. 

according to the eye inspection, li jiajia (should be the original name of li ziyu) established sichuan ziyu culture communication co., ltd. on july 20, 2017, and wei nian is its shareholder, holding 51% of the shares. supervisor, li jiajia holds 49% of the shares. 

according to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd., including greenland holdings, zte, xinhua media, vanke, light media, etc. . 
among the shareholders of weinian technology, sina weibo is particularly eye-catching. 

from wei nian technology to sina weibo, li ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to. 
in her own words, she changed from โ€a little transparent to a person who is so useless to societyโ€. after entering the public view and being noticed by more people, li ziyiโ€s sense of responsibility has also become heavier. 
โ€i want to do what i can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non-heritage cultural craftsmen, and i want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. li ziyi said. 

source: https://www.ww01.net/en/archives/33757","如果您在这里是新手，那么这绝对是您需要了解的有关Liziqi（Li Ziyi）的一切：

1990年，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）跌倒在四川米扬（Mianyang）。她的父母很小的时候就离婚了。后来，她的父亲去世了，李齐伊成为孤儿。他的继母对她不好。李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）在微博上提到，当他的继母将头发拖入排水沟并被殴打时，他有半死的经历。

爷爷和奶奶使孙女感到沮丧，最后决定带李Ziyu回家。当李齐伊（Li Ziyi）五年级时，他的祖父再次去世，他的祖母很难抚养她继续上学。李齐（Li Ziyi）在14岁时不得不辍学，独自去城市努力工作，并开始了八年的流浪生活。她的第一人生非常艰难。她睡在公园椅上，挠头两个月。

Li Ziyi还曾在酒店担任服务生，每月薪水为300元。为了赚取更多的收入，她去学习演奏唱片并在酒吧里唱歌。后来，在谈论此事时，李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）坦率地说：“我不是说当时我喜欢音乐，只是为了生活，我觉得这是付出的。”

2012年，由于奶奶曾经生病，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）担心她后来会后悔，扔掉所有工作并返回奶奶。 “靠近，我感到更加放松。”

返回后，李Ziyi开了一家淘宝商店，但业务一直在运行，他几乎没有吃饭。 2015年，在他的弟弟的影响下，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）接触了短视频平台Meipai。直到2016年，看到他的弟弟在Meipai上有一些粉丝，并且拥有更多的粉丝可以改善淘宝业务的心态，Li Ziyi重新进入Meipai，为自己的视频节目做准备。

她之所以选择以这种风格拍摄视频与她的童年环境密切相关的原因。

李·齐（Li Ziyi）在接受西那俱乐部（Nina Club）的客厅采访时说：“所有这些在农村自给自足的事情，对我来说，它们嫉妒。在简短的视频中，她选择从最熟悉的地方开始。

一开始，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）称自己为“四个季节变化，吃饭时吃饭”。在Meipai编辑的建议之后，它变成了“古老的食物”，并且今天仍然使用。

2016年9月，一个新的机会悄悄地出现了，这也成为李Zyu将来更加关注的重要推动者。 Sina Weibo开始公开寻找更多出色的简短视频创建者以获得资源支持。

正如文章开头所述，刘·汤明（Liu Tongming）为她带来了微博的资源支持。

2016年9月的一天，古老的简短视频博客作者Li Feng意外收到了“先生先生的私人微博消息”。 L”。 L先生表达了对李Ziyu的视频内容的热爱，觉得他已经实现了他的作陶王的梦，并希望与她见面。

此后很长一段时间，Li Ziyi收到了L先生的私人信。 “这样一个好视频让这个人看到它是可惜的。这是中国和世界各地的人们应该看到USCHINA骄傲的传统文化。 “先生。我在一条私人消息中说。

起初，在看到这些私人消息后，李Ziyi并不在乎太多，甚至不必担心遇到骗子。直到一天，L先生来到了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）所在的城市，并想请她吃饭和聊天。 L先生的礼貌和清晰的逻辑思维使李慢慢地放弃了最初的警报。

这次偶然的会议彻底改变了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）的生活轨迹。用餐结束后不久，在L先生的帮助下，李·Zizheng（Li Zizheng）得到了Sina Weibo的大量资源的支持，加快了她的知名度，并允许Li Zizhen赶到头部网络影响者的排队。

这种经历部分记录在那年的李Zizheng日记中。一些与温尼安技术高级管理人员接近的内部人士证实了腾讯的“申旺”，即“先生先生L”实际上是刘·汤明（Liu Tongming），他的化名是公开报道的。 Wei Nian Technology的创始人Daxiong Liu是Li Zizhen现在属于的MCN公司。

12月8日，一个标有“是文化产出”的微博主题的阅读量攀升至8亿。李Zizheng再次在热门搜索列表中。

Li Ziyi和她创建的视频现在已成为一个值得研究的现象。

广泛的海外沟通是李齐伊安（Li Zihuan）重新关注的重要原因。有人说她已经拍摄了理想的乡村生活，并传播了中国传统文化和美食的魅力。其他人则认为她的视频并非完全正确地反映中国的乡村生活。

自从爆炸再次提出以来一直很受欢迎的疑问，例如成为DJ，成为富人的第二代，无论是我自己的视频，是否有强烈的推动力，视频是真的对于农村生活，这仍然是角色环境的小说。

Weinian Technology的一位内部人士告诉Tencent的“ Deep Web”，Li Ziyi是普通的，相关的视频内容是由Li Ziyi本人制作的。受欢迎程度不是公司和他本人的倡议。实际上，他背后的李·齐伊安（Li Zihuan）和微读团队都非常低调，他们非常热情，拒绝了当前的所有采访需求。

直到2018年8月17日，Li Ziyi的同名TMALL商店正式开业。上网六天后，当时只有五种产品的商店的销售额超过150,000，销售额超过1000万。一年后，李Zizhen旗舰店展示的21种产品的总销售额超过130万，总销售额达到7100万。
Li Ziyi的IP背后的价值正在迅速挖掘。

Li Ziyi从头开始，并以自己的力量获得了第一批粉丝。但是现在，声名和财富的受欢迎程度和收益显然不再只是她的成就。
根据Tianyan Search的说法，“ Deep Web”表明，Li Ziyi属于的McN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。于2013年2月28日成立，其注册资本为5.208亿元。根据引言，Wei Nian是一家娱乐娱乐公司，通过简短的视频将KOL孵化为IP，并扩展到消费者品牌。

Qixinbao的信息表明，商标“ Li Zihuan”有100多种知识产权信息。申请人公司是Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。产品类别包括食品，服装，鞋子和帽子，染料和脂肪，染料和脂肪，啤酒和饮料，金融物业管理，餐饮和住宿。

不仅如此，Wei Nian还与Li Ziyu的公司建立了不可忽视的联系。

根据眼睛检查，李亚吉亚（应该是李祖的原始名称）于2017年7月20日成立了四川Ziyu文化传播公司有限公司。主管Li Jiajia持有49％的股份。

根据其他数据，Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。的背后有多达50家受益公司，包括Greenland Holdings，ZTE，新华社媒体，Vanke，Light Media等。
在Weinian技术的股东中，Sina Weibo特别引人注目。

从Wei Nian Technology到Sina Weibo，Li Ziyi逐渐拥有互联网名人期待的最佳卡片。
用她自己的话说，她从“有点透明变成了一个对社会无用的人”。在进入公众观点并被更多人注意到之后，李齐的责任感也变得更加重。
“我想尽我所能，做更多对社会有益的事情，例如传统文化，非遗产文化工匠的传播，我想向所有人展示这些旧事物，以便更多的人知道。李Ziyi说。

在我国，印度尼西亚甚至拥有更多种类的传统和文化，我们的土地也生产出非凡的农产品。我们可以为亚洲国家，尤其是印度尼西亚而感到自豪。

29466,UgzZzJbuNnUNCMBVlIR4AaABAg.8xjFGku-_Z_8yojVT_eoiA,1,"@paulchen1067 i don't know if it is your understanding of your understanding or not to see it carefully. what i said is ""actually protecting taiwanese netizens and beneficial to taiwan"", not ""to protect taiwan"". although the research and development of firewalls, although it is not subjective to protect taiwan, it objectively protects taiwan and protects taiwan. as for the reasons for the research and development of firewalls, many domestic forums have discussions, which are mainly summarized as:
first, because there are many yellow adult websites outside the wall, these pornographic websites do not have any protection, and children can open it at will. these primary school students who are still studying are not seen. the two children should see these pornographic adult websites when they should not see these things, so it protects my children at least. i am very grateful;
second, many fake news of rumoring and discredited chinese demons outside the wall flies. some people who are not mature are not enough to distinguish. it is easy to be misleading. it is the same as the brainwashing sun flowers in taiwan. the united states. the country is very good at using tools such as the internet and traditional media to combine the right to speak and subvert other countries in combination with the right to speak in the hand. the spring of arabia, which occurred in a series of countries in a series of countries in the middle east, is the united states and other use of the internet hegemony to incite and subvert other countries. the big ""masterpiece"", the current violent turmoil that occurs in hong kong is the same. as long as those who have a little mind and a little international insight can see clearly. assuming that the middle east countries also had comprehensive internet protection measures at that time, they would not be by the united states. using social media such as the internet to easily incite their domestic fighting and turmoil, it ultimately leads to the tragic situation of war, the people's non -talk, refugee flowing, and economic collapse. the history of traditional colonial countries such as the united states and britain used the internet to infiltrate and subvert the country in one day or two. the intelligence department uses the internet and other tools to conduct as many as 39 countries that have infiltrated and subverted other countries. this is what the united states is said in hillary's mouth. china's firewall to a certain extent has a certain blocking effect on this intelligence agency using the internet to incite public opinion and cause social turmoil to ultimately achieve the ""ingenious strength"" of subverting the country's regime. the entire exposure of the eyelids of the anti -chinese countries will be manipulated by the information departments such as the united states, which leads to the chaos in hong kong today. the purpose of trump is to use hong kong as a bargaining chip to the extreme of china to pressure china. in order to eventually occupy more cheap china in the trade war negotiations.
third, in fact, for the consideration of national security, many countries have walls, south korea, and germany, usa, and germany. india envy china to have bat, and it is ready to engage in the wall. after all foreigners, snowden exposed the prism door, especially after the german chancellor merkel's mobile phone was listened to the cia, germany was also building a wall. it seems that this is a trend. the internet has now become a new battlefield. the major countries are developing network troops and building walls crazy, but the forms are different. the united states has long been set off the world in the world. in addition to prism doors, there are also five -eye alliances. the internet world has long been reduced to the colonies in the united states without knowing it. the ability to be capable of capable of has a wall. only those who are unable to build it are going. the american wall is much more advanced than the chinese wall technology. it is difficult to find that this is really a bit embarrassing. in fact, the background is also recording cross -border traffic and even secretly analyzing the content of the mail package. similar words such as ""production"" and ""buying suicide bombs"", and soon, fbi agents came to your house to search. these are keywords and sensitive words monitoring techniques. obviously haha, the chinese wall is a pediatric department compared to the american wall. chinese technology can only monitor itself, and even the technology can not completely make it unable to turn the wall. however, lao and american technology can monitor the world. the gap is really not a little or two, but a generation and two generations.
some people say that china is engaged in net walls to be afraid that domestic people will know what the so -called truth, and the actual situation is exactly the opposite. if you are really afraid of people in the country to know what the so -called ""truth"" and why do you put so more than 100 million domestic in china a year people go out to see ""truth""? can you stop it? are you afraid that more than 100 million people will go out to see the ""truth""? obviously this is conflict. china has more than 150 million people every year, and 130 million foreigners entering china have become the world's largest in the world. one of the tourist destinations, as many as 10 million foreigners living in china, as many as 60 million chinese people living abroad, hundreds of foreign embassies and consulates in china, more than 100,000 foreign media resident reporters, there are more than 10 million international multinational companies and foreign trade companies are held in hundreds of international conferences and large -scale activities in china each year. after 40 years of opening up, china has already been integrated into the world in all aspects. in the era of information such in information, everyone can spread through the global era when everyone picks up a mobile phone, saying that the idea of โ€โ€being afraid of people know what ""truth"" is really naive, and it also proves how ridiculous the guessing people who want to eat melon for granted. essence
the fourth is to protect the growth and growth of its own internet industry. do not want to be occupied by american companies like the same domestic internet as the world. the top ten important network industries in the world are either the united states or in mainland china, and they have begun to enter the global market. the top ten internet companies in the world, each of which each country and the united states are half. other countries are zero. some people once said that there are only two world internet countries. the united states and china (this is permanently set in wuzhen, zhejiang, zhejiang, china. to. mainland china โ€s internet strength is second in the world. although the overall strength is still far behind the united states, it is the only country that is comparable to the united states in the internet field. the european union, india, russia, canada, japan, australia cannot do it, because of the degree of pain, the market, the market, the population, the population, the funds, the language, the policy, the technology, culture, etc. when we laughed at this firewall, we did not know that only from politics, the vision of thinking was so narrow, and the sour people's vision was like a rat, foolish. the internet achievement of the walls of the wall in china is: we have created a set of our own network industry chain, the second largest in the world. and when netizens all over the world brush fb and yt every day, when google's hou, they did not realize that their countries, including some european countries, have become ""colonies"" in the united states of the united states, not only the online market and public opinion were facebook, but they were facebook. foreign network power control dominates other foreign network power control, and the people of their domestic companies must also pay expensive advertising fees and usage fees. and all the personal data of their national and enterprises, all of which are stored in the server of the us internet company giants, have long been safe. in the past two years, fackbook has repeatedly gone out the incidents of leakage of their personal information information and selling. it is one of the proof.
the fifth is to facilitate the management of the network and crack down on cyber crimes. the internet is the same as a real society. every day, a lot of criminal activities are filled with criminal activities. some of them have subverted the country, illegal operations, and criminal criminals, such as online fraud, money laundering, online gambling, mlm, cult transmission ... and police officers in a country it can only be enforced in its own country because of the multinational nature of the internet. if criminals set up the server abroad, and criminal activities such as fraud on ordinary people in the country, the police can only watch them implement criminal crimes against domestic abroad. there is no way to manage it. this is not a good thing for the interests of ordinary people. this wall can filter most of this kind of overseas fraud, gambling, money laundering, etc. most filtering can increase the difficulty of crime of overseas criminal criminals, which is valuable. ordinary people do nโ€t care about turning over the wall, and they do nโ€t touch the law. for example, college students write papers to check foreign language information, etc., and 99%of chinese resources are on the internet in the country. the chinese content outside the wall is added. there are more than 1%. compared to those who do not understand foreign languages, the wall is the real sea. it is just a small puddle on the wall. i am not proficient in foreign languages. individuals are proficient in a foreign language, so there is no great impact on the wall. besides, this firewall does not block all foreign websites outside, but just block part of the content of the country and the people. many foreign websites can be accessed directly. domestic ipv6 users, and some campus networks. education network can directly access foreign websites. many domestic websites, including apps, can also be accessed directly from abroad, such as weibo, douyin, and douyin, douyin, douyin, and douyin, douyin, and douyin, douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin. douban ... you can access it directly from abroad, and the firewall is not intercepted by a knife. there are so many embassies, multinational companies, foreign trade companies, foreign -related institutions, universities, and research institutions. this number is an astronomical figure. so many people are legally used to use external networks for daily work and business. even the official cctv in china is on yt. with the official channel, it can be seen that the role of the firewall is not to block the network and outside the network. the function is obviously filtering, filtering out those things that are harmful to national security and the interests of the people, and retaining beneficial things. a person is sick alone. everyone knows to go to the hospital to see a doctor. when you take medicine and take medicine, you have to remove the germs that endanger your body to keep your body healthy. why can't the internet be filtered out of those bad things and keep the internet be healthy. in short, weighing the advantages and disadvantages and comprehensive considerations, li yuan is more than disadvantaged.
the above just means that i am not ""refuted for refutation."" everyoneโ€s iq, eq, experience, observation, and international vision are different. the depth and breadth of thinking are different, but one thing must be remembered. that is, don't float in the appearance, don't want to be cloudy, but get rid of prejudice and settings, think independently, and approach the essence and truth. in this way, you can truly achieve ""not confused"" without being stupid. break and use.","@paulchen1067 不知道是你的理解力问题还是看得不仔细，我说的是“实际上保护了台湾网民，对台湾有利”，不是说“为了保护台湾”。研发防火墙，主观上虽然不是为了保护台湾，但客观上保护了台湾，既“实际上”保护了台湾。 至于研发防火墙的原因，国内很多论坛上都有讨论，主要归纳为几点： 
一是因为墙外很多黄色成人网站，这些色情网站没有任何防护，小朋友都可以随意点开，这些总不能让那些还在念书的小学生初中生等小朋友看到才对吧，反正我是不希望我家的两个小朋友在不该看到这些东西的年龄看到这些色情成人网站的，所以它至少保护了我家的小孩，我是很感激的； 
第二，墙外很多造谣抹黑妖魔化中国的假新闻满天飞，有些年纪不大还不成熟的人思考力分辨力还不够，很容易被误导就跟台湾那些被洗脑的太阳花觉青一样，美国等国家非常擅长利用互联网和传统媒体等工具结合手中控制的舆论话语权对他国进行意识形态的渗透和颠覆，发生在中东一系列国家的阿拉伯之春就是美国等利用互联网霸权煽动颠覆它国的一大“杰作”，目前发生在香港的暴力动乱也是如此，只要稍微有点脑子有点国际洞察力的人都看得一清二楚，假设当时中东国家也拥有完善的互联网保护措施，也就不会被美国等利用互联网等社交媒体轻易就煽动其国内的内斗和动乱，最终导致如今这些国家战火纷飞、民不聊生、难民流离、经济崩溃的惨状。美英等传统殖民国家利用互联网对它国进行渗透颠覆的历史可不是一天两天了，从乌克兰到摩洛哥，从利比亚到叙利亚，从埃及再到委内瑞拉，据维基解密统计，冷战结束后，美国CIA等情报部门利用互联网等工具对它国进行渗透颠覆搞掉的国家多达39个，这就是希拉里口中所说的美国的“巧实力""吧，毕竟美国掌握着全球互联网霸权和舆论话语权，而中国的防火墙在一定程度上对这种情报机关利用网络进行舆论煽动和造成社会动荡最终达到颠覆别国政权的“巧实力”有一定的阻挡作用，而香港正是因为互联网过于开放，毫不设防，整个暴露在反中国家的眼皮底下，才会被美国等情报部门随意操弄，导致今日香港乱局，而特朗普的目的正是要将香港搞乱作为向中国极限施压的一个筹码，以便于最终在贸易战谈判中占到中国更多便宜。 
第三，实际上出于国家安全的考虑，很多国家都有墻，韩国有，美国俄国德国都有，印度羡慕中国有BAT，也准备要搞墙了，泰国防部建立“天网” 追踪境内全部外国人，斯诺登曝光棱镜门后，尤其是德国总理默克尔的手机被美国中情局监听后，德国也在筑墙，看来这是趋势，网路现在已经成了一个全新的战场，各大国都在发展网络部队，疯狂筑墙，只是形式不一样而已，而美国，早就在全世界布下了天罗地网，除了棱镜门，还有五眼联盟，监视全世界，完全没设防的国家，网络世界早就沦为了美国的殖民地而不自知，有能力的国家基本都有墻，没能力建设的就只有随它去了，而美国的墻比中国的墻技术先进多了，一般人都很难发现，这个确实有点屌，其实后台一样在记录跨境流量甚至暗中抓取邮件包内容自动分析，发邮件人一点感觉都没有，在美国境内上网发表“刺杀特朗普”""轰炸白宫""或“制作”“购买自杀式炸弹”等类似字眼，很快就有FBI的探员来你家敲门搜查了，这些都是关键词、敏感词的监听技术，不像中国的墙简单粗暴，太明显了哈哈，中国墻跟美国墻相比就是小儿科，中国的技术只能监控自己，甚至技术还达不到完全让网民无法翻墙哈，但老美的技术却能监控全世界，中美的技术水平差距真的不是一点两点，而是一代两代。 
有人说中国搞网墙是为了怕国内的人知道什么所谓的真相，实际情况正好相反，如果真是怕国内的人知道什么所谓的“真相”，那干嘛每年还放那么多一亿多国内的人出去看“真相""？挡得住么？不怕这一亿多人出去看到“真相”么，显然这是自相矛盾的，中国每年出国人数一亿五千多万人次，入境中国的外国人1.2亿人次，中国已成为全球最大的旅游目的国之一，在中国生活的外国人高达一千多万，居住在国外的华人高达六千多万，中国常驻有数百个外国使领馆，十多万国外媒体常驻记者，有一千多万家国际跨国公司和外贸公司，每年在中国有数百场国际会议和大型活动召开，历经40年的开放，中国早已全方位深度融入了全球，每年这么多与世界的联系与互动，在资讯这么发达，人人拿起手机随手一拍就能传遍全球的时代，说怕人知道什么“真相”的想法真的极其幼稚，也证明国内那些想当然的吃瓜群众的猜测显得多么荒谬。 
第四，是为了保护国内自己的互联网產业的成长壮大，不希望跟全世界一样国内的互联网全被美国公司佔领。全世界排名前十的重要网络产业，不是美国的就是中国大陆的，而且开始进军全球市场。全球十大互联网公司，中美各占一半，其它国家为零，有人曾言，世界互联网大国只有两个，美国和中国（这点从世界互联网大会会址永久定在中国浙江乌镇就不难看出）。中国大陆互联网实力全球第二，虽然整体实力仍远远落后于美国，却是唯一在互联网领域有机会媲美美国的国家。欧盟，印度，俄罗斯，加拿大，日本，澳大利亚都做不到，因为痛合度，市场，幅员，人口，资金，语言，政策，技术，文化，等等各种因素。当我们在嘲笑这个防火墙的时候，殊不知，只从政治看问题，眼界思维如此之狭隘，酸民眼光如鼠、愚不可及。在中国这设墙的二十多年的互联网成果是：我们打造了一套属于自己的网络产业链，全球第二大。而当全世界的网民每天在刷着FB、YT，谷歌的时侯，他们完全没有意识到自己国家包括一些欧洲国家已经沦为网络经济强国美国的“殖民地”，不仅网络市场和舆论被Facebook、Yahoo、Google等外来网络强权控制主导，其本国企业要接触自己的民众还必须支付昂贵的广告费和使用费等等费用。而把自己国家国民和企业的个人资料，隐私等全部储存在美国互联网公司巨头的服务器里，早已毫无安全可言，过去两年Fackbook公司多次暴出将其用户个人信息资料泄漏出卖的事件便是明证之一。 
第五，是为了便于网络的管理，打击网络犯罪。网络和现实社会一样，每天充斥着大量的犯罪活动，有颠覆国家的，非法营运的，还有刑事犯罪的，比如网络诈骗，洗钱，网络赌博，传销，邪教传播这些……而一个国家的警察只能在其本国境内执法，因为网络的跨国性，如果刑事犯罪分子把服务器架设在国外，而对国内的普通民众进行诈骗等犯罪活动，警察只能眼睁睁看着他们在境外实施对国内的犯罪，却没办法管得到，这对普通百姓的利益绝非好事，而这堵墙能过滤掉大部分这种境外诈骗、赌博、洗钱等针对国内民众的犯罪，虽然不能完全百分百过滤，但过滤大部分，能增加境外跨境刑事犯罪分子的犯罪难度，已经难能可贵了。普通人没事翻翻墙不会管，而且也不触法，比如 大学生写论文翻墙查外文资料等，而99%的中文资源都在境内的互联网上，墻外的中文內容加起來也沒有墻內的1%多，相對于不懂外语的人來說，墻內才是真正的大海，墻上只是一個小水坑而已，不熟练掌握外语，你翻出來也是來到了一片沙漠，因为并不是每个人都精通一门外语的，所以翻不了墙并没有什么太大的影响，况且这个防火墙并不是把所有外国网站全部挡在外面，而只是把一部分的对国家和百姓利益有害的内容拦在外面，国外很多网站是可以直接访问的，国内IPV6用户，还有一些校园网，教育网都是可以直接访问国外网站的，国内很多网站包括APP也可以从国外直接访问，比如微博、抖音、豆瓣......等都可以从国外直接访问，防火墙并没有一刀切地拦截。国内那么多大使馆、跨国公司、外贸公司，涉外机构、高校、研究机构，这数字是个天文数字，这么多人都在合法地使用外网进行日常工作和业务，连国内官方的央视都在YT上开了官方频道，可见防火墙的作用并不是要阻断网内和网外，其功能显然在于过滤，过滤掉了那些对国家安全和百姓利益有害的东西，保留了有益的东西，一个人生病了都知道去医院看医生，打针吃药甚至做手术都要除掉危害身体的病菌让身体保持健康，为什么互联网就不能过滤掉那些坏的东西让网络保持良性健康呢。 总之，权衡利弊，综合考虑的话，利远大于弊。 
以上，只是说明我并不是“为反驳而反驳”，每个人的智商、情商、阅历、观察力、国际视野都不一样，思维的深度、广度也不一样，但有一点是必须记住的，即不要浮于表象，不要人云亦云，而是摆脱成见和定势，独立思考，接近本质与真相，这样，才能真正达到“不惑”，且不会被愚蠢的自以为是绑架，更不会被他人的言辞蛊惑和利用。"

before the reform and opening up after the cultural revolution, the urban and rural areas of china always retained the buildings and production and living models and status left by manqing. deng xiaoping sent water ghosts to taiwan's lianlian lin yifu from golden gate, and lin yifu broke the trick to subvert the world. since then, the chinese government has printed banknotes to exchange banknotes day and night. foreign trade subsidies are lower than cost -effective global economic aggression to destroy the european and american family industry light industry and become the world's richest ruling group. the dictatorship of 1.4 billion people has become the world hegemon. europe has been controlled by china today. the united states has died. china has been allowed to enter the city for a meager income forty years ago from forty years ago. the government ’s intentional day and night tofu residue project has accumulated the original agricultural workers’ blood -sweat. by now, the stock market housing market controlled by zhu rongji ’s son has repeatedly absorbed the hard -sweat of the national slave! high -speed transportation throughout the high -speed building everywhere, flicker inexplicable high -end consumption! excuse me, which brick tile belongs to you? you are just alive!

文革后改革开放之前，中国城乡始终保留停留在满清留下来的建筑以及生产生活模式以及状态。邓小平派水鬼从金门接来台湾连长林毅夫，林毅夫一语道破颠覆世界的诀窍。从此中国政府日夜印刷钞票兑换欧元美金。外贸补贴低于成本全球经济侵略摧毁欧美家族工业轻工业从而成为世界最富有的统治集团。独裁集中十四亿人的血汗成为世界霸主。如今欧洲早已经被中国控制。美国已经亡国。中国遍地从四十年前开始，许可农奴进城用命换取微薄的收入。政府故意日夜豆腐渣工程积累最初的农工血汗，到如今朱镕基儿子管控的股市房市，反复猛烈吸纳国奴的血汗！遍地高楼大厦高速交通，忽悠莫名其妙的各类高端消费！试问，哪一块砖瓦属于你的呢？你仅仅是苟活而已！

as many as 10 million dogs are believed to be killed for their meat annually in china, with up to 10,000 killed for the yulin festival, according to the washington-based humane society. while much of the meat comes through legitimate farms, many dog slaughterhouses are run privately and secretively to avoid scrutiny by food-safety inspectors. 
all you have to do is google ""chinese eat dog"" and read and see a myriad of videos and articles like this one from their south china morning post: https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/community/article/2113704/eating-dog-meat-china-might-only-be-annual-affair-why-does . so sad...... they say that many urban people are no longer eating dog meat daily (mostly a rural mindset now) still the fact that they (as a country) still celebrate eating dogs at that terrible yulin dog meat festival that they beat them and torture them before killing them (they say the adrenaline released during the torture improves the taste of the dog meat) is disturbing to people that love dogs as part of their families.","@Islandfolk2283这就是中国媒体所说的！您可以在此处及其互联网上查看中国记者和新闻来源的信息（和图片）：

据总部位于华盛顿的人道协会称，据信每年在中国每年有多达1000万只狗因其肉而杀死10,000只狗。尽管大部分肉来自合法的农场，但许多狗的屠宰场都是私下和秘密地运行的，以避免受到食品安全检查员的审查。
您所要做的就是Google“中国吃狗”，然后阅读并在中国南方早晨观看无数的视频和文章：https：//www.scmp.com/news/news/hong-kong/community/文章/2113704/饮食狗 - 少女 - 少年时代的恋人。很难过……他们说，许多城市人不再每天都在吃狗肉（现在主要是乡村心态）仍然是，他们（作为一个国家）仍然在那个可怕的Yulin狗肉节上庆祝吃狗他们在杀死他们之前殴打他们并折磨他们（他们说在酷刑期间释放的肾上腺素可以改善狗肉的味道），这让爱狗作为家庭的一部分感到不安。"

if you got confused when i was talking about other chinese channels inspired by japan, let me explain. in japan, it became very popular to post stuff in a very zen, almost pretentious way and there were cooking channels doing a similar thing. a bunch of chinese people started copying that and so we have channels like these, one's that are a bit pretentious but fun to watch. i mean, we can all clearly see she's probably a city girl, but it's not that big of a deal.","426firefly我没有看到其他任何风格类似的中国频道。该频道开始于2017年8月21日，而克罗地亚频道的Almazankitchen开始于2015年5月20日开始，因此很可能Li Ziqi受到了他们的启发。
如果我在谈论日本启发的其他中国频道时感到困惑，请让我解释一下。在日本，以一种非常自命不凡的方式发布东西变得非常流行，并且有类似的事情做烹饪频道。一群中国人开始复制它，因此我们有这样的频道，这有点自命不凡，但很有趣。我的意思是，我们都可以清楚地看到她可能是一个城市女孩，但这并不是一件大事。"

ps, though serious, but the culture creates the country, from everyday words. small, as on the world map they write ""east sea"" is the sea ""south china"", and that is the issue of sovereignty, right? i am not very political, but even though i am very admiring chinese culture, like to listen to chinese music, watch chinese movies, read love language, watch happy camp, love luo and hoa than vu. but that is only a good aspect that we see. if you have seen some chinese films about the vietnamese border war, you will see the filmmaker misrepresented and made your country (no matter how bad he won) and china lost in the english position. how is hung. it is just a movie, not to mention education or economics. so hope you sympathize if you seem serious the problem. ♡ (∩o∩) ♡ i just want to be honored in china and vietnam.","@chihacthien-gs9lk也是亚洲人

when i said, 'knowing i shouldn't, if you are right....', i meant that i wouldn't disrespect or disregard or be ignorant of the hurt it might cause people who know the truth, whatever it may be, since i have no access to it, which is why, the former comment was followed by my desire of confirmation. don't conveniently choose to see one part and ignore the other. 
i can see your point that the subtitles are inconsistently strewn over videos, and had it been truly propaganda, it would have been differently so. wish you had said it sooner. 
as for me asking you to read the thread, i truly believed you didn't. since your comment about semantics was wrongly placed. i was talking about my language. however, i didn't mean to condescend to you, and if you felt bad about it, then i apologize. hope you will accept it. if you feel that, that was my intention, let me assure you it wasn't. and no, i don't mean that just because you belong from china, i see all chinese people that way. you have absolutely no grounds to base that upon. i merely enquired about it. and i am having a reasonably calm discussion with a stranger on a dangerous virtual platform, does that indicate that i am putting everyone in the same category? as for technology, i know for a fact that she has an imac, a professional editing machine. she edits her own videos. before you twist that as well, let me make it clear that she doesn't do it on her phone, is all i am saying. i can't help but feel like a lot of your feelings about my comments are culled from your perception of how the world sees china. and please stop seeing it from the angle that i am criticizing her videos. i can't press enough on the fact that i never did. i am very glad to know that she is a positive source of inspiration for the people of china. so please, i insist you stop dragging that cat through the mortar. i have been courteous to you, and apologized if your sentiments were hurt. i will have to request you stop misinterpreting my every word. and you did read things that you wanted to read. since i didn't mean them, i know i am speaking the truth. 
yes, every country does try to promote itself, and i will wager that a lot of it is actually propaganda. my country does it, so does the others. the difference is that the people have a right to prove them wrong on a public platform. we have the right to criticize them openly and call them on their misrepresentation. and here, the remark is about the government, not your culture or people. 
finally, i will reiterate that my intention was not to hurt your feelings. you think there was an ulterior motive. there wasn't. you think that i think the apples don't fall far from the tree. i don't. and my deduction was just that, presence of a crew. that could indicate a joint project of a political nature, but in this case, as you rightly suggested, it doesn't, since the subtitles are spare. 

now, i am tired of explaining things again and again. i hope you understand. and good day.","@DesignQQQ8905 hmm。好吧，我看到我的评论在哪里唱歌。让我清楚地表明您正在阅读很多东西。不，我并不是说，如果我看到中国的联合项目，我应该得出这样的结论：这是宣传。那是您的解释，希望您在看到错误时会承认自己的错误。因为那不是我的意思。
当我说：“知道我不应该，如果你对... ，由于我无法访问它，这就是为什么，前者的评论之后是我对确认的愿望。不要方便地选择看到一部分而忽略另一部分。
我可以看到您的观点是，字幕在视频上不一致，如果确实是宣传，那将是不同的。希望您早日说。
至于我要你阅读线程，我真的相信你没有。由于您对语义的评论被错误地放置了。我在谈论我的语言。但是，我并不是要屈服于您，如果您对此感到难过，那我深表歉意。希望你会接受。如果您觉得那是我的意图，让我向您保证不是。不，我并不是说仅仅因为您属于中国，我都会看到所有中国人。您绝对没有理由以此为基础。我只是询问它。而且我正在与一个危险的虚拟平台上的陌生人进行相当平静的讨论，这是否表明我将每个人都属于同一类别？至于技术，我知道她拥有一台专业编辑机器的iMac。她编辑自己的视频。我只说，在您扭转这一点之前，让我清楚地表明她不在手机上做到这一点。我忍不住想像您对世界如何看待中国的看法，您对我的评论的许多感觉都被淘汰了。并且请不要从我批评她的视频的角度看到它。我从未做过的事实不足。我很高兴知道她是中国人民的积极灵感。所以，我坚持要你停止将那只猫拖到砂浆上。我对你很有礼貌，如果你的情绪受伤，道歉。我将不得不要求您停止误解我的每个单词。您确实阅读了想阅读的东西。由于我不是他们的意思，所以我知道我在说实话。
是的，每个国家都试图提升自己，我会敢打赌，其中很多实际上都是宣传。我的国家也这样做，其他人也这样做。不同之处在于，人们有权在公共平台上证明他们是错误的。我们有权公开批评他们，并致电他们的虚假陈述。在这里，言论是关于政府的，而不是您的文化或人民。
最后，我将重申我的意图不是伤害您的感受。您认为存在别有用心。没有。您认为我认为苹果不会落在树上。我不。我的推论就是，船员的存在。这可能表明一个政治性质的联合项目，但是在这种情况下，正如您正确建议的那样，这不是，因为字幕是备用的。

现在，我厌倦了一次又一次的解释。我希望你明白。和美好的一天。"

(no matter who sets the trap. no matter it is related to the second law of thermodynamics.) it is a robbery.
the diversity of life is complicated, so that ""the mirror is unchanged, and the phase variant is unchanged. so as a rosary."" i, i, i, ... "". is it inevitable? is it considered a progress or evolution, and there is no need for discussion. (even science is fans. fans from all walks of life can't offend)
with me, i lost my own (so -called me, my self -definition: i have it, there is no need to read me.)
freedom often, no need to find.
riding a donkey to find a donkey, looking for his head, anxiety, nervousness, and pain (to crazy). this should be a common sense and cannot be avoided. even if you do n’t go to the school to receive instilling (the ancient and modern chinese and foreign instills are paste, big witch and small witch, fifty steps and hundred steps, the same), and being named by the parents at the “niang gow”. essence
this may be the price that the so -called civilized progress (or the so -called prosperity development) must be paid.
the concept noun, according to ""a brief history of humanity"", is a powerful weapon for the wins of the homo sapiens.
it now appears that this is a double -edged sword.
human beings are about to (or have already) so crazy to destroy this world (this prison, this corner field, the fighter field)
anyway, each ownership (there are all kinds of promises. including nothingness, or even absurdity, each have their own fans.)
go to see marx, go to see the ancestors .......
the so -called conflict of civilization is not just the dispute between the conceptual dispute, the mixed geographical skin color and even the habit of dispute, etc.
there are unified thoughts, standardization, simplification, part -time, systematic, modern, and global blessings. these war machines cannot stop.
this may be a disaster that will usher in the evolution of life.
i got a hint from a great place many years ago. unexpectedly, it is so obvious now. (at least for me, it is obvious)
the effort to try to try with the mud has long failed, but now it has been verified that this is basically a car.
let's practice it. only practice.
xin zhai did not, the cliffs were scattered, and he fell into the darkness at all, admitting ignorance. (from a song from pu shu)
or can get new life. heaven and man are one, and the tao is not out of the foreigner. it is often sufficient. as a result, calmly, facing the ending of life and even the universe.
(but pay attention: unequal mind and easy to enter the magic.)

renewal: continuity. it was mainly inspired by the story of the knowledge of knowledge (good and evil differences) by the temptation of the snake.
some people say that adam's original sin originated from eve's lying. in fact, there is no snake, it is eve to seduce adam himself.
i wrote a short article to refute this absurd interpretation. (yi zhongtian believes that this snake is related to reproductive worship. it is more than this more than this.)
see ""adam's original sin (eve did not lie)"" 6park.com
""diamond sutra"": ""no one, no one, no one, no beings, no life.""
generally explained as equal treatment. not bad. but what is the ""life""?
some people say that it is a fake word of ""suffering"", and those who have no sufferings depends on the appearance of through the body. it is also easy to say, but it is not coherent with the context.
i think: the so -called life, regardless of longevity and shortevity, and those who have a life span. (not only beings, not life, but also life.)
the actual feiya is not moving, fang sheng fang died, fang dead fangsheng (zhuangzi) has a life span, which is the illusion or illusion that memory brings us (like visual retention) 6park.com

mirror opposite is a metaphor, which is more important. it can be said: everyone (even all perception sentient beings) is a bright mirror that is the same.
(the dimension is pushed. we are a two -dimensional plane in front of us. it is not three -dimensional. three -dimensional logic from our straight logic. what we see is illusion. we can't see the actual space. it's bent.)
including the body, it is just a mirror image.
where did this sensory mirror come from? no one knows.
at least i don't know, i can only guess. at present, my recommended conjecture is: energy conservation, energy first.
if you have energy, you must light up your consciousness, and even the so -called non -organism. it is definitely not self -conscious, or even if it is, it is extremely vague and extremely unstable. 6park.com
the metaphor of a rosary, like snakes, seduces selfish self -cultivation.
on one occasion, a netizen asked me: why did he feel that he had many previous lives and died in the same nanjing massacre.
i made an analogy. zhuangzi: fang sheng is dead, fang dead. for example, the mahjong card stacked together.
the difference is just stacked neatly. there is still the next life, and it still has to be empty and it is not worth pursuing. 6park.com
regarding the second law of thermodynamics, due to the lack of professional knowledge, it cannot be accurately judged. at present, it is considered that: uniform distribution is an orderly. the complexity and diverse life (each gene is different, including twins, including clones, there are somewhat places to copy wrong homework, and there is no mutation or evolution), which is disorderly.
therefore, there is no contradiction between the laws of thermodynamics and the evolution of species. it cannot be misleading because someone wrote this book or made a prophecy, thinking that the world should live like this, and it is better to destroy it. see the contradiction between the second law of thermodynamics and evolution?

this may not be avoided. 6park.com
collective, it is mainly bad in the modernization of standardization industrialization.
the so -called civilization, the so -called cultural circle, has become a war machine that has become unified.
(western advocating personality is an illusion. actually, the family cannot standardize it into a screw, which is not conducive to industrialization. see ""another brick on the wall"")
this simple and orderly repeatting is a reactionaries that violate the heavens, not a variety of complicated life.
energy is conservative, life will not be cut off, and the big deal will change the form. the standardization of the systemic and the cold war machine will inevitably be destroyed.
i kept at the nuclear winter.

(there is no determination to go to the end of the hundreds of millions of people, and there is no spirit of swallowing the ten directions in the lone peak, and talk about the real awakening.
even if it is a praying arm blocking the car, the wind is not shining anyway, try it again. .

personally, you can practice xinzhai's inaction and let the cliffs let it go.
dharma: foreign interest (let go of my persistence, like persistence), there is no breath in the heart (letting go of the law, the mirror persistence)
this is the mind, not in the external behavior, meditation or standing piles, running or sleeping, let alone practice unnecessary asceticism.
altar scriptures: there is no need for righteousness and evil. long extension lying on his feet.
one foot evil, that is, obsessed with foreign ministers, one foot is positive, that is, imagine the infinite perceptual body (it is too easy to enter the magic, because there is no difference between good and evil)
don't do the so -called good things, let alone do bad things (not chinese culture too much sauce cylinder, some people are dull by themselves)
the method of inaction is the principle of leverage, the alternative use of cathode and yang (see ""alternative application of leverage principles"")
be careful of all the so -called proofs, especially the sudden sensitivity, such as suffering from a sense of purity, sober, clear and clean ...
there is no need to do thousands of miles in life experience. this does not become a test, mainly depending on the inner and unequal (see ""equal equality and entering the magic"")","劫不从天外来。相续相（寿者相，记忆相，时间相）、对象化思维（镜像对立、能所对立、心物对立、我与非我的对立）、自我意识，是个陷阱。（无论是谁设的陷阱。无论与热力学第二定律有没有关系。）更是一个劫。
生命之多样复杂，以至于敏感到“像变镜不变，相变体不变。从而串起一条念珠。“我，我，我,.......”. 是不是演化的必然，算不算进步或进化，也没有讨论的必要。（连科学也是有粉丝的。各路粉丝都得罪不起）
有了个我，反而失去了本我（所谓本我，我的自我定义：本就有的，没必要念的我。）
自在常在，无须寻找。
骑驴找驴，迷头觅头，焦虑紧张烦恼痛苦（以至于疯狂），这应该是人之常情，也无法避免。即便不去学校接受灌输（古今中外灌输的都是浆糊，大巫小巫，五十步与百步，一样的），被父母指着“娘生褂”起个名字，就已经是迷失的开始了。
这也许是所谓文明进步（或所谓繁荣发展）必须付出的代价。
概念名词，据《人类简史》，是智人胜出的有力武器。
现在看来，这是柄双刃剑。
人类快要（或已经）疯到要不惜毁去这个世界（这个监狱，这个角斗场、斗兽场）
反正各有各的归属（各有各的应许之地。包括虚无，甚至荒诞，也各有各的粉丝。）
去见马克思，去见祖宗.......
所谓文明的冲突，不止于理念之争宗教之争，混杂了地域肤色甚至习惯之争等等等等
有统一思想、标准化、简单化、零件化、系统化、现代化、全球化的加持，这些战争机器是停不下来的。
这或许是生命演化出自我意识后，就必将迎来的一劫。
我很多年以前就从某位大能处得到暗示。没想到如今已如此明显。（至少对我来说已经很明显了）
试图和稀泥的努力早就失败，如今不过再次验证这基本上是螳臂当车。
还是实修吧。也只有实修了。
心斋无为，悬崖撒手，不惜坠入黑暗，承认无知。(出自朴树的一首歌）
或能获得新生。天人本一，道不外人，常在具足。从而自在从容，潇洒面对人生乃至宇宙的ending。
（但是要注意：心不平等易入魔。)

相续相：连续感。主要受夏娃被蛇诱惑吃了知识果（善恶分别果）的故事的启发。
有人说亚当的原罪源于夏娃的撒谎。其实没有蛇，是夏娃自己要诱惑亚当。
我曾写了篇短文反驳这种荒唐的解读。（易中天认为这蛇与生殖崇拜有关。也比这强了不止一点。）
参见《亚当的原罪（夏娃没有撒谎）》 6park.com
《金刚经》：“无我相，无人相，无众生相，无寿者相。”
一般解释为要平等对待。大抵不差。但何谓“寿者”？
有人说是“受”的通假字，无受者，就是说要看穿身体这个表相。也说得通，但与上下文不太连贯。
我认为：所谓寿者，不分长寿短寿，有寿命可计的都是寿者。（不仅是众生，非生命，也是寿者。）
而实际飞矢不动，方生方死，方死方生（庄子），有寿命可算，是记忆带给我们的错觉或幻象（好比视觉暂留） 6park.com
关于记忆相与时间相，请看《先天第一因（背景与源头）》 6park.com
关于对象化思维与自我意识陷阱，请看《对象化思维（自我意识陷阱）》 6park.com
镜像对立，是个比喻，比较重要。可以这么说：人人（乃至所有的知觉众生）都是一面同样圆满的明镜。
（维度是推想出来的。我们眼前是个二维的平面。不是立体的。三维来自我们笔直的逻辑。我们看到的是幻象。实际的空间我们看不到的。按物理学来说不是平直的是弯曲的。）
包括身体，都只是镜中像。
这个知觉镜到底从哪里来的，没人知道。
至少我不知道，只能猜。目前我比较推荐的猜想是：能量守恒，能量第一性。
有能量必然点亮知觉，连所谓的非生物也是一样。只是肯定没有自我意识，或即便有，也是极其模糊极其不稳定的。 6park.com
一串念珠这个比喻，和蛇一样，都是引诱人自私自利修来世的。
有一次，某位网友问我：为什么他觉得自己有很多前世，都是死于同一场南京大屠杀的。
我打了个比方。庄子：方生方死，方死方生。好比叠在一起的麻将牌。
区别只是叠得整齐不整齐。来世下面还有来世，还是要清空了重来，不值得追求。 6park.com
关于热力学第二定律，由于缺乏专业知识，无法准确判断。目前倾向于认为：均匀分布是一种有序。生命的复杂多样，（每个基因都不同，包括双胞胎，包括克隆，都多少有抄错作业的地方，没有变异就没有演化或进化），是一种无序。
因而，热力学定律与物种演化论并无矛盾。不能因为有人写了本书或做了个预言，就被误导，认为世人活该如此，毁灭了更好。参见《热力学第二定律与进化论矛盾吗？》 6park.com
如果我们面临一劫，不从天外来，来自我们自己的疯狂，究其因，就是自我意识产生后必然造成的自我迷失。
找不到真正的自己，必然要攀援（执着于镜中像，例如身体或金钱，笔杆子，刀把子，等等等等）或妄想（执着于对于镜的猜想，各种名词之争，以至于所谓文明的冲突，不惜毁了这个世界，也要维护自己的信念）
这未必不能避免。 6park.com
从集体来说，主要坏在标准化工业化现代化全球化，
所谓的文明，所谓的文化圈，已经各自成为统一了思想的战争机器。
（西方崇尚个性是个幻象，实际是家庭无法规范成一个个螺丝钉，不利于工业化。参见《墙上的另一块砖》）
这种简单有序的重复灌输才是违反天道的反动派，不是多样复杂的生命体。
能量守恒，生命不会断绝，大不了换个形态，标准化零件化体系化的热战或冷战机器必然覆灭。
自己不停就止于核冬天。
（成吉思汗的战争机器也很“现代化”，百夫长千夫长万夫长的连排制度，从各部落独立出人质建立近卫军，
以职能设立军官等等等等。而且全民皆兵，可以配给配额，没有三饷从哪里来之类的烦恼。
胜利者一定比较先进吗？） 6park.com
（没有虽亿万人吾往矣的决心，没有独居孤峰顶一口吞尽十方的气魄，奢谈真正的觉醒。
哪怕是螳臂挡车，反正风吹不动光，再试试吧。）

从个人来说，可以修习心斋无为，悬崖撒手。
达摩：外息诸缘（放开我执，像执），内心无喘（放下法执，镜执）
这是心法，不在于外在的行为，打坐还是站桩，跑步还是睡觉，更不要去修什么无谓的苦行。
坛经：正邪俱不用。长伸两脚卧。
一脚邪，即迷恋外相，一脚正，即想象无限大的觉性本体（过分了容易发狂入魔，因为本无大小善恶之分）
所谓好事都不要做，更不要说做坏事了（不是中国文化太酱缸，是有的人自己愚钝）
无为心法，是杠杆原理，阴极而阳的另类使用（参见《杠杆原理的另类应用》）
要小心一切所谓的证明，特别是突然过于敏感，例如突获清净感、清醒清晰干净......
人生历练不一定要行万里路。本不成为考验，主要看内心平等不平等（参见《心不平等易入魔》）"

万里长城、孔子、旗袍在历史上都是韩国的文化。 孔子出生在韩国的庆州，有韩国血统的父母，万里长城是韩国人为保护韩半岛免遭敌人袭击而建造的。 旗袍也是韩服中变形的衣服。 韩国人想打扮的时候穿韩服，睡觉的时候没有格调的场合穿旗袍。 现在可以看到中国的少数民族穿旗袍，那是借着很久之前的韩国文化维持至今的。

8461,UgwPoTpWMAaTT5If8QB4AaABAg,0,"@(now china) 10 civilizations.
let's understand the culture that began in the country on the mainland when there was a country in china and the culture that started in china.
in summary, it can be said that it is the top 10 civilizations of the mainland.
that is the plague (pest), foot binding, burning books, confucianism, mao zedong, cultural revolution, tiananmen revolution, sars (sars), huangsha, wuhan pneumonia (covid-19), fake imitation row.

the four major inventions advocated by modern china or most of the culture of china called the originator of their originator are false, or the culture of other countries, and advocate that china is the originator.
regardless of the past mainland countries and modern china, people's minds are empty.
in particular, the recent chinese people have been cross -wisdom by the communist party, and they have lost their wisdom of independent judgment.
therefore, they really believe that the communist party's false institutional is shouting the communist party every day, and china is the world's highest country.
the chinese who lived with the slavery of the communist party felt very desolate.
however, there is no need to feel pitiful or regretful, because the chinese are very happy because they do not realize their own situation.
so outsiders have no reason to destroy their happiness.

there are very few chinese people who know the heroes of chinese heroes mao zedong, and even those who know they dare not say.

mao zedong is a lascivious. he especially likes a 10 -year -old girl who is not adults and women.
it is said that the older women knew too much about the world and said that there was no innocence.
moreover, it is said that a woman who likes to have husbands, especially the low education level with low education level.
when he was in his 70s, in the local guidance, there was a husband who was in his early 20s. after asking the name, mao zedong wrote his name on the manual. dongxing encouraged the husband of the husband to divorce and dedicated it to mao zedong.
it is said that he and a husband who had a husband gave birth to a few illegitimate children.

mao zedong's sexual desire is very strong, and he is basic to his wife. he has a sexually transmitted disease and melamine disease.
therefore, women who have sex with mao zedong have this disease.
but those women were proud of the disease.
at that time, mao zedong, who was worshiped in china at the same time as the living god, was in the same bed, which was a very proud thing in itself.
instead, the facts of being infected with mao zedong's sexually transmitted diseases are used as a medal. this phenomenon can be said to be crazy.

mao zedong has never washed his genitals in his life.
once, his attending doctor li zhisui mentioned health issues. mao zedong said: ""i have been bathing in a woman's body, so it doesn't matter.""
not only that, the body itself did not clean it, and the river people wiped them with a wet towel.

mao zedong's tooth health is really bad, there is no brushing, and a bit of bitter tea from chinese tea often instead of brushing your teeth with bitter tea. a lot of.

@cannot be managed by this image to manage their own leaders, the chaotic leaders in private life, and the chinese brain of the chinese who regard the people who regard the people as a hero.
the chinese do have serious mental illness.
they should be locked in mainland china and should not let them come to the world to pollute the earth.
china is a malignant tumor of the earth, and the chinese are cancer cells that torture the earth.
therefore, in order to prevent the earth's disaster, all the chinese must be located in mainland china.","@亚洲大陆东部的国家(现在中国)10大文明。
让我们来了解一下大陆上存在中国以前的国家时开始的文化和现在始于中国的文化。
综合起来，可以说是大陆起源的10大文明。
那个是鼠疫(PEST)、缠足、 焚书坑儒、毛泽东、文化大革命、天安门革命、非典(SARS)、黄沙、武汉肺炎(COVID-19)、假货模仿排场。

现代中国主张的4大发明品或中国称其鼻祖的大部分文化是假的，或者偷窃其他国家的文化，主张中国是鼻祖。
无论是过去的大陆国家，还是现代的中国，人们的头脑都是空空的。
特别是最近的中国人被共产党所弩化，丧失了自主判断的智慧。
因此，他们真的相信共产党的虚假煽动，天天喊着共产党万岁，中国是世界最高的国家。
以这种共产党的奴隶生活的中国人感到非常凄凉。
但是，没有必要对此感到可怜或惋惜，这是因为中国人没有意识到自己的这种处境而感到非常幸福。
所以外人没有理由破坏他们的幸福。

@了解中国人英雄毛泽东现实的中国人很少，即使是知道的人也不敢说出口。

毛泽东是个好色之徒，特别喜欢不是成人女性的10多岁少女。
据说，上了年纪的女子们对世事过于了解，而且说没有纯真的味道。
而且据说喜欢有夫之妇，特别是喜欢教育水平较低的纯朴的农村妇女。
70多岁的时候，在当地指导时，有一个20岁出头的有夫之妇，毛泽东在问完名字后，在手册上写上自己的名字，非常喜欢，看到此情此景的心腹汪东兴怂恿有夫之妇的丈夫离婚，并献给了毛泽东。
据说他和有夫之妇生下了几个私生子。

毛泽东性欲很旺盛，对妻子不伦不类是基本，患有一种性病，三聚氰胺的疾病。
因此，与毛泽东发生性关系的女人都得了这种病。
但是那些女人反而为得了那个病而自豪。
当时与中国崇拜得如同活生生的神一样的毛泽东同床共枕，这本身就是一件非常值得骄傲的事情。
反而把一起感染毛泽东性病的事实当作一种勋章，这种现象可以说是疯了。

毛泽东一辈子都没有亲手洗过自己的生殖器。
有一次，他的主治医生李志绥提到卫生问题，毛泽东说:""一直在女人的体内洗澡，所以没关系。"" 
不仅如此，身体本身也没有洗干净，河人们用湿毛巾擦身。

毛泽东的牙齿健康确实很糟糕，没有刷牙，而且经常喝中国茶的一种苦茶，用苦茶代替刷牙，所以牙齿健康非常不好，牙石和食物残渣很多，牙龈都积满了脓，蛀牙也很多。

@不能用这种形象管理自己的领导人、私生活混乱的领导人、把百姓视为自己玩物力的领导人视为英雄的中国人的大脑，不能不说是研究对象。
中国人确实患有严重的精神病。
应该把他们关在中国大陆，不应该让他们来到世界污染地球。
中国是地球的恶性肿瘤，中国人是折磨地球的癌细胞。
因此，要想阻止地球发生大灾难，必须将中国人全部关到死为止中国大陆内。"

before this, i watched two long video documentaries about how chinese life in rural areas are. most of them are about children living alone, taking care of their siblings and managing livestock/farm while parents work in the city to earn money since opportunities are not enough in the countryside.
i do get your point about the whole production/business part and that there's a so-called ugliness behind the camera. though i admit, her videos about cooking inspire me and gives me comfort.
i grew up and live alone in an apartment in the city, i have always desired to live someplace like what she's showing us in her videos. i guess my whole point is yes, it may be ugly as you say behind the scenes, (hardships and all) but then again, living is full of challenges. still, i respect your opinion.","谢无言我两个月前订阅了此频道，我正在随机滚动我的供稿，并决定在她的频道中重新观看她的视频。
在此之前，我观看了两张有关中国在农村地区生活的漫长视频纪录片。他们中的大多数是关于一个独自生活的孩子，照顾兄弟姐妹和管理牲畜/农场，而父母在城市工作以赚钱，因为在农村的机会还不够。
我确实明白了您对整个生产/业务部分的观点，并且相机背后有一个所谓的丑陋。尽管我承认，她的烹饪视频激发了我的灵感，并给了我安慰。
我长大，独自生活在城市的公寓里，我一直希望住在某个地方，就像她在视频中向我们展示的那样。我想我的全部要点是，正如您在幕后所说的那样，这可能很丑陋（艰辛和所有），但再说一次，生活充满了挑战。不过，我尊重您的意见。"

shouldn't you questioning about what you have been told by the western media now? you are so self-righteous to say people are worldview distorted and brainwashed bla bla by only knowing that i'm a chinese and i speak for china. look who is brainwashed now? i think a mature adult should know to see things dialectically. we or i never say that xi made himself president for life is right or good. actually we were very upset with this even though we know that chinese political system is originally not democratic. but after thinking about the time when all my americans friends had to choose a worse president out of the worst, and the time when the british ordinary voted for brexit but was shocked by the result because they were suppose to vote it for fun, i do think that it might not be a bad thing. because ordinary people have no idea what and who they are voting(americans votes for what they have been promised by the candidates, but god knows if the promises can really became real. most of the time they are fulled by the candidates, or in the end the voted president didn't make his promise come true if though they might want to keep his promises). if xi is a good president and can lead the chinese to better economy and a more united country, why could let him be a life president? i know you would start your noble democracy literature like other westerners. but fuck off democracy! democracy is not the only right way to run a country. actually, is democracy a right way is a good question as well. look at how the democracy has decreased or stopped the economy in most western countries! even america, look at how old their highways are and the terrible road conditions; the average annually income hasn't change much in 10 years, not even mentioning other western countries. they are falling. i like what the former president of singapore lee kuan yew said: countries like us who need to catch up do not need democracy. we have to gather our resources and use it to one and only goal. that is what suitable for us. and now look at what a marvelous country he managed to build from nothing! no homeless, super safe society with diverse culture and people from different background. thus your democracy doesn't work and suits others. don't be bully judging others by thinking only your way is the right way. that is very immature thought. but you are not immature in only that aspect, look at how funny you said about nathan rich. he said things you didn't familiar but contradict to what you thought then you said this person has no integrity but just to please the chinese. why do you stop trying to be a truth-fighter now by criticizing about his content but instead to attack this person? cause you know you don't have the ability to say it out loud that what he had said was unreal. you want to but you cannot.only i and other who truly have ever lived in china can have that right to say if what he said is true or fake. we were arguing if the content in the western media is true or not right? why come to nathan rich's videos, you switched to just subjectively judging a person instead of arguing the objective video contents? so stop lecturing about your so called ""freedom of speech"" cause it's actually not existing in america either. youtube's algorithms has set limits to the reviews of videos which contents the authority don't want you to see. so don't be childish, believe what you have seen by your real eyes. that's why i recommend nathan rich's videos cause the chinese current situations described by him is the one i know of and experienced. i live outside china but i do go back every now and then. i worked and lived in the states from 2012-2018 in a world top tech company having top 5-10% american annually income, but i still feel the huge problems of american society. the extreme white left politicians, the stupid law of letting the criminals to go away if the assets amount they get from robbery or stealing is under $975, the unavoidable frequent car window broking robbery, the drug problem, the disgusting streets of sf with homeless and their shits. your democracy just don't work that well, ok? just accept the truth that not everyone want this and they can live a good life without this. after my american greencard application got current, i had to make a choice if i really wanted to live here and raised my child in a society like this. our answer was no and my family voted by our own feet--we moved out of the states. so all the above came from a person who had really lived in both china and america, sorry to let you down and snapped your face about your brainwashed and worldview distorted conclusion. but if you insist by saying this poor chinese is just so deeply brainwashed even your great truth teller western media couldn't save her back in 7 years, feel free to say so.",@oc-cpa终于在回复的最后一个回复中提出了一个很好的问题吗？是的，为什么一个没有言论自由或新闻自由的痛苦的中国人甚至会出现在本网站上？您现在不应该质疑西方媒体所告诉您的内容吗？您是如此自以为是，以至于人们只知道我是中国人，而我为中国说话，人们就被世界观扭曲和洗脑了。看谁现在被洗脑了？我认为一个成熟的成年人应该知道辩证的事情。我们或我从未说过习近平使自己终身总统是正确的。实际上，即使我们知道中国政治制度本来不是民主的，我们对此感到非常沮丧。但是，在考虑了我所有的美国人朋友都必须从最糟糕的情况下选择更糟糕的总统的时间，而英国普通人投票赞成英国脱欧，但对结果感到震惊，因为他们本来应该投票赞成娱乐，我确实如此认为这可能不是一件坏事。因为普通人不知道他们在投票的是什么（美国人都投票赞成候选人所承诺的东西，但上帝知道承诺是否真的可以变得真实。在大多数情况下，他们都被候选人或在结束选票的总统不会做出他的诺言，尽管他们可能想兑现他的诺言）。如果习近平是一名好总统，可以带领中国人走向更好的经济和更加统一的国家，为什么让他成为终身总统？我知道您会像其他西方人一样开始您的崇高民主文学。但是，滚蛋民主！民主并不是经营一个国家的唯一正确方法。实际上，民主是正确的方法也是一个很好的问题。看看大多数西方国家的民主如何减少或阻止经济！甚至美国，看看他们的高速公路年龄多大和可怕的道路状况。每年的平均收入在10年内没有变化太大，甚至没有提及其他西方国家。他们跌倒了。我喜欢新加坡前总统李·库恩（Lee Kuan Yew）所说的：像我们这样的国家，需要赶上的国家不需要民主。我们必须收集我们的资源，并将其用于一个唯一的目标。那就是适合我们的。现在看看他设法从一无所有地建立了一个奇妙的国家！没有各种文化和来自不同背景的人的无家可归，超级安全的社会。因此，您的民主不起作用并适合他人。不要通过仅思考自己的方式来欺负他人是正确的方法。那是非常不成熟的想法。但是，您并不是在这方面并不成熟，请看看您对Nathan Rich的说法有多有趣。他说您不熟悉的事情，但与您的想法相矛盾，然后您说这个人没有诚信，而只是为了取悦中国人。为什么您现在不再试图通过批评他的内容而试图成为真相战斗机，而要攻击这个人？因为您知道您没有能力大声说出他所说的是虚幻的。您想，但您不能。只有我和其他曾经住在中国的人可以说他说的是真的还是假的。我们在争论西方媒体中的内容是正确的吗？为什么要参加内森·里奇（Nathan Rich）的视频，您改用了主观评判一个人而不是争论客观视频内容？因此，不要再对您所谓的“言论自由”进行讲授，因为它实际上也不存在于美国。 YouTube的算法已设定了视频评论的限制，该视频内容不希望您看到。因此，不要幼稚，相信您的真实眼睛所看到的。这就是为什么我推荐内森·里奇（Nathan Rich）的视频，原因是他所描述的中国当前情况是我知道和经历的。我住在中国以外，但我不时地回去。从2012年至2018年，我在一家世界顶级科技公司中工作并居住在美国，每年获得5-10％的美国收入，但我仍然感到美国社会的巨大问题。极端白人左派政客，如果他们从抢劫或偷窃的资产金额不到975美元，那是让罪犯离开的愚蠢法律，这是不可避免的经常发生的车窗经纪抢劫，毒品问题，令人恶心他们的狗屎。您的民主制度不太好，好吗？只要接受并非每个人都想要这个的事实，没有这个，他们就可以过上美好的生活。在我的美国绿色申请中申请后，如果我真的想住在这里并在这样的社会中抚养我的孩子，我必须做出选择。我们的回答是否定的，我的家人用自己的脚投票 - 我们搬出了美国。因此，以上所有内容都来自一个真正生活在中国和美国的人，很抱歉让您失望，并为您的洗脑和世界观扭曲了结论。但是，如果您坚持说这个可怜的中国人被深深地洗脑了，即使您的伟大真相teller teller teller媒体无法在7年内拯救她，请随时这样说。
