now load videos in weibo, a chinese platform, since people in china do not have access to youtube or facebook, etc. and his fans raise their videos on youtube so that the other part of the world can enjoy this beauty.


here is an edition to answer your questions:


1-this is an official youtube account and she benefits from this account but is not sure of the other channels.


2 - it used to produce its content alone, but after receiving recognition she began working with a small team to help her photograph, but i think she is not pretending the way she lives.


3-vive in sichuan (china).

现在，在中国平台上加载视频，因为中国的人们无法访问YouTube或Facebook等。他的粉丝在YouTube上提出了视频，以便世界的另一部分可以享受这种美丽。

1-这是一个YouTube官方帐户，她从该帐户中受益，但不确定其他渠道。

the point is, i hope that everyone is calm, discuss things, and try to listen to it as much as possible.

don't bully a diligent, brave and intelligent girl.

according to the good cat catching the mouse, li ziyi is not an outstanding good cat. not to mention the renminbi income, she made a lot of money on the international stage, about tens of thousands of dollars a day, envy everyone, realize her dream of serving her grandmother's life, and obtaining the harvest of no dare to expect. impressive.

nearly 8 million foreign fans, everyone shows the truth, kindness showing the video. unconvinced? if you try it, you will know. jiang feng, the most popular self -media chinese, has subscribed for 280,000, is already an example for many people. it's just 3%of this little girl.

the videos of overseas cattle guo wengui are only watched tens of thousands of people every time. li ziyi's video is five or six million. the best 30 million. the video three years ago was searched every day, and the number of clicks continued to skyrocket.

this is not a general miracle.

i spent the strength of nine niu and tiger to make a video. so far, i only have 160 subscriptions, and the best video is watching more than 1,000 people.

i know li ziyi's weight. everyone also weighs.

everyone has the most discussions. the most misunderstanding of li ziyi is that she is just an actor, and her work is made by a huge team.

please understand her development history a little.

li ziyi had a childhood young man who had been unable to look back, had various workers, and had a long period of time for a person's exploration of experiments. he finally rely on his talents, hard work, hard work, and succeed.

the current situation, i am afraid that zhang yimou is likely to be a director. of course, li ziyi does not need zhang yimou. i have an analogy. li ziyi has no self -learning talent, and the artistic talent shown is no worse than zhang yimou.

li ziyi rely on his own efforts to come to this day. you open your eyes and talk nonsense, and you are unwilling to do basic investigations and research. he maliciously pour dirty girls to a hard -working girl.

really blushing for you. be kind. do nโ€t be so rude and hateful.

true: li ziyi's true, not that she is too beautiful, not what kind of shoes are wearing in the farmland. in my eyes, li zizhen's true, manifested in her hard work, hard work, and manifested in her soul. nothing will do.

of course, she will not seriously and deliberately express the hardships of the peasants in sichuan and the sufferings of rural poor today. li ziyi is pursuing the amount of subscriptions and click volume. her performance is basically impeccable.

li ziyi truly shows her own pursuit of life and her own state of life.

of course, try your best to beautify. otherwise, where can i subscribe?

good: see her depending on the grandmother's life, and take care of each other. thinking that grandma finally got a good life, she was really happy.

thinking of my work hard for a whole life. li ziyi's kindness is one of the biggest highlights of the video.

beauty: needless to say. i admire me and admire from the bottom of my heart. some people will say, team teams, foreign announcements and so on.

you just need to see li ziyi's earliest video to feel her artistic talent.

besides: with the current situation of li ziyi's current daily gold, let alone the government, any of the people with funds will not hesitate to make a behind -the -scenes team.

dawai xuan:

where is this? what big publicity? what a crime is to have no words. a girl mixed with meals, accidentally red and purple, do nโ€t tm โ€s blind eyes?

but here to tell the government and the communist youth league, do not speculate. stir good things. what is the blind ginseng?

the government was not stupid, and i saw li ziyi's success and wanted to use it. in fact, maybe good intentions have become bad things. with my concept, the government, the communist youth league, the best leave her alone. it is not as good as the last four, truth, goodness and beauty.

ziyi, please be careful. no need to cooperate too deeply with the government. tell them to let you develop freely in accordance with their greatest interests. otherwise, the end may not be good for anyone.

cut!

during the seven years of labor in rural areas during the revolution, the hardships of the rural areas of china's rural areas know a little.

the reason why li ziyi feels is because most of the farm work that li ziyi has done has done it, and i will even accept the soles of the shoe. i rushed the cow to rake the ground in the paddy field, and i tried it. if you can't try it, you have to give it to the poor farmers around him. very difficult work. i did not dry the back of the mountain from the mountain. there are no bamboo or mountains there. almost all of the others can't be familiar. rice, wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, pigs and sheep beef, planting vegetables. we do not plant fruit trees. moving the bricks by myself and moving the bricks. at the age of seventeen, he was cooking for fifteen students.

li ziyi used bamboo to make a sofa for me too much. too admire!

ziyi, refueling ๅฟ…๏ธ do not worry about it. take your own way and let others have a way. don't ignore some people's words of talking nonsense.

ps

ziyi does not necessarily know the history of 12 million people starved in sichuan during the great famine. mianyang is the hardest hit area. please know. it is important to your future development.","最近李子柒担任“中国农村青年致富带头人推广大使”，引发新一轮评论热潮。看了一些，忍俊不禁，有感而发，希望能够提供不同视角。

关键是，希望大家平心静气，就事论事，尽量做到兼听则明。

不要语言欺凌一个勤劳勇敢聪慧的女孩子。

按照逮着老鼠就是好猫的说法，李子柒不啻是一只杰出的极其优秀的好猫。不说人民币收入，她大把大把的在国际舞台上赚美元，大概每天几万美元吧，羡煞众人，实现自己养家糊口侍奉奶奶的人生梦想，获得原本不敢奢望的收获，可喜可贺令人钦佩。

将近800万外国粉丝，大家是冲着视频展现的真善美来的。不服气？你试试就知道了。海外最红的自媒体华人江峰，28万订阅，已经是很多人崇拜的榜样。仅仅是这小姑娘的3%。

海外牛人郭文贵每次的视频也只是几万人看。李子柒的视频动辄五六百万。最好的3千万。三年前的视频还在被人每天搜索，点击量继续暴涨。

这可不是一般的奇迹。

我费了九牛二虎之力做视频，至今只有160订阅量，最好的一个视频1000多人观看。

我知道李子柒的分量。大家也掂量掂量。

大家议论最多，对李子柒误解最大的是，她不过是个演员，工作都是一个庞大的团队做的。

请稍微了解一下她的发展史。

李子柒有过不堪回首的童年少年，有过各种打工经验，有过很长时间一个人摸索实验失败，最后靠自己的才华，勤奋，努力，获得了成功。

现在状况，恐怕邀请张艺谋来做导演都有可能。当然李子柒不需要张艺谋我是打个比方。李子柒无师自通自学成才，表现出来的艺术天分，不比张艺谋差一丝一毫。

李子柒完全靠自己的努力走到今天。你们睁着眼睛瞎说八道，连基本的调查研究都不愿意做，恶意向一个勤劳致富的女孩子泼脏水。

真替你们脸红。Be kind. Don’t be so rude and hateful.

真：李子柒的真，不是表现在她穿着过于漂亮，不是表演在穿着什么样的鞋子在农田里劳作。在我的目光里，李子柒的真，表现在她的勤劳，吃苦耐劳，表现在她的心灵手巧。啥都会干。

她当然不会去认真刻意的表现四川绵阳农民的辛苦和今日农村贫困人群的苦难。李子柒追求的是订阅量，点击量。她的表现基本无懈可击。

李子柒真实的表现了她自己对生活的追求，她自己的生活状态。

当然要尽力美化。不然哪里来订阅量？

善：看她和奶奶相依为命，互相关照。想到奶奶终于过上好日子真为子柒高兴。

想起自己姥姥勤劳一生。李子柒的善良，是视频最大亮点之一。

美：毋庸赘言。令我感佩，从心底里佩服。有人又会说了，团队团队，大外宣等等。

你只需要去看看李子柒最早的视频就能感觉到她的艺术天分。

再说一遍：以李子柒目前日进斗金的状况，别说政府，任何一个有资金的人都会毫不犹豫甘作幕后团队。

大外宣：

这哪儿跟哪儿啊？什么大外宣？真是欲加之罪 何患无辞。一个女孩子混口饭吃，不小心大红大紫，别TM的瞎着眼胡说八道好不好？

但是此处敬告政府和共青团，别投机不成舍把米。把好事搅合了。瞎参和什么呢？

政府不傻，看到李子柒的成功趁机想利用起来。其实也许好心办成坏事儿。以我的观念，政府啊共青团啊什么的最好leave her alone. 免得最后四不像，真善美不在。

子柒也请慎重。不必和政府合作太深。告诉他们让你自由发展符合他们的最大利益。不然最后也许结局对谁都不好。

切切！

在下文革时期在农村劳动七年多，对中国农村的苦难农民的艰辛略知一二。

之所以感觉李子柒的真实，就是因为李子柒干过的农活儿大部分我都干过，我甚至会纳鞋底。赶着牛在水田里耙地，我试过。怎么试都不行只好交给身边的贫农代表。很不容易的活计。从山上砍竹子背下山没有干过。我们那里没有竹子也没有山。其它几乎都再熟悉不过。水稻，小麦，玉米，红薯，养猪羊牛，种菜。我们没有种水果树。自己盖房子搬砖头用手推车运转头。十七岁当炊事员专职为十五个同学做饭。

李子柒用竹子做沙发让我太佩服了。太佩服！

子柒，加油

PS

子柒不一定知道大饥荒时期四川饿死1200万人的历史。绵阳是重灾区。请一定了解一下。对你今后发展至关重要。"

10991,UgzVXwN2Sk-mZ8X4ecJ4AaABAg,5,2 years ago,"if you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about liziqi ( li ziyi ): 

in 1990, li ziyi fell to the ground in mianyang, sichuan. her parents divorced when she was very young. later, her father died, and li ziyi became an orphan. his stepmother didnโ€t treat her well. li zizhen mentioned on weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten. 

grandpa and grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take li ziyu home and live. when li ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. at the age of 14, li ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. her first life was very hard. she slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months. 

li ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. in order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. later, when talking about the matter, li zizhen frankly said: โ€i didnโ€t say that i liked music at that time, just to live, i felt that it was well paid.โ€ 

in 2012, because grandma was ill once, li ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. โ€being closer, i feel more at ease.โ€ 

after returning, li ziyi opened a taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. in 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, li ziyi was exposed to the short video platform meipai. until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of taobao business, li ziyi re-entered meipai to prepare for his own video program. 

the reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment. 

in an interview with the living room of sina club, li ziyi mentioned, โ€all these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. in the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places. 

in the beginning, li ziyi gave himself a topic called โ€four seasons change, eat while you eatโ€. after the suggestion of meipai editor, it became โ€ancient foodโ€ and it is still used today. 

in september 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for li ziyu to get more attention in the future. sina weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support. 

as mentioned at the beginning of the article, liu tongming brought her weibo resources support. 

one day in september 2016, li feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private weibo message from โ€mr. lโ€. mr. l expressed his love for li ziyuโ€s video content, felt that he had fulfilled his taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her. 

for a long time after that, li ziyi received mr. lโ€s private letter. โ€it would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. this is uschinaโ€s proud traditional culture should be seen by people in china and around the world. โ€mr. l said in a private message. 

at first, after seeing these private messages, li ziyi didnโ€t care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. until one day, mr. l came to the city where li zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. mr. lโ€s politeness and clear logical thinking made li slowly drop his initial alert. 

this accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of li zizhen. not long after the meal was over, with the help of mr. l, li zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on sina weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing li zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head. 

this experience is partly recorded in a diary of li zizheng that year. some insiders close to the senior executives of weinian technology confirmed to tencentโ€s โ€shenwangโ€ that the โ€mr. lโ€ is actually liu tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. daxiong liu, the founder of wei nian technology, an mcn company to which li zizhen now belongs. 

on december 8th, the reading volume of a weibo topic labeled โ€is li ziyi a cultural outputโ€ climbed to 800 million. li zizheng was once again on the hot search list. 

the video created by li ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now. 

extensive overseas communication is an important reason for li zihuanโ€s renewed attention. some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional chinese culture and cuisine. others think that her video is not completely true to reflect chinaโ€s rural life. 

even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a dj, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life itโ€s still just a fiction for character setting. 

an insider of weinian technology told tencentโ€s โ€deep webโ€ that li ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by li ziyi himself. the popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. in fact, both li zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs. 

until august 17, 2018, li ziyiโ€s eponymous tmall store officially opened. six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. a year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the li zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million. 
the value behind li ziyiโ€s ip is being quickly tapped. 

li ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. but now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements. 
according to tianyan search, โ€deep webโ€ shows that mcn hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd., which li ziyi belongs to, was established on february 28, 2013, with a registered capital of rmb 5.208 million. according to the introduction, wei nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates kol into ip through short videos and extends to consumer brands. 

the information of qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark โ€li zihuanโ€. the applicant companies are hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd. the product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, financial property management, catering and accommodation. 

not only that, wei nian also has inextricable links with li ziyuโ€s companies. 

according to the eye inspection, li jiajia (should be the original name of li ziyu) established sichuan ziyu culture communication co., ltd. on july 20, 2017, and wei nian is its shareholder, holding 51% of the shares. supervisor, li jiajia holds 49% of the shares. 

according to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd., including greenland holdings, zte, xinhua media, vanke, light media, etc. . 
among the shareholders of weinian technology, sina weibo is particularly eye-catching. 

from wei nian technology to sina weibo, li ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to. 
in her own words, she changed from โ€a little transparent to a person who is so useless to societyโ€. after entering the public view and being noticed by more people, li ziyiโ€s sense of responsibility has also become heavier. 
โ€i want to do what i can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non-heritage cultural craftsmen, and i want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. li ziyi said. 

source: https://www.ww01.net/en/archives/33757","如果您在这里是新手，那么这绝对是您需要了解的有关Liziqi（Li Ziyi）的一切：

1990年，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）跌倒在四川米扬（Mianyang）。她的父母很小的时候就离婚了。后来，她的父亲去世了，李齐伊成为孤儿。他的继母对她不好。李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）在微博上提到，当他的继母将头发拖入排水沟并被殴打时，他有半死的经历。

爷爷和奶奶使孙女感到沮丧，最后决定带李Ziyu回家。当李齐伊（Li Ziyi）五年级时，他的祖父再次去世，他的祖母很难抚养她继续上学。李齐（Li Ziyi）在14岁时不得不辍学，独自去城市努力工作，并开始了八年的流浪生活。她的第一人生非常艰难。她睡在公园椅上，挠头两个月。

Li Ziyi还曾在酒店担任服务生，每月薪水为300元。为了赚取更多的收入，她去学习演奏唱片并在酒吧里唱歌。后来，在谈论此事时，李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）坦率地说：“我不是说当时我喜欢音乐，只是为了生活，我觉得这是付出的。”

2012年，由于奶奶曾经生病，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）担心她后来会后悔，扔掉所有工作并返回奶奶。 “靠近，我感到更加放松。”

返回后，李Ziyi开了一家淘宝商店，但业务一直在运行，他几乎没有吃饭。 2015年，在他的弟弟的影响下，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）接触了短视频平台Meipai。直到2016年，看到他的弟弟在Meipai上有一些粉丝，并且拥有更多的粉丝可以改善淘宝业务的心态，Li Ziyi重新进入Meipai，为自己的视频节目做准备。

她之所以选择以这种风格拍摄视频与她的童年环境密切相关的原因。

李·齐（Li Ziyi）在接受西那俱乐部（Nina Club）的客厅采访时说：“所有这些在农村自给自足的事情，对我来说，它们嫉妒。在简短的视频中，她选择从最熟悉的地方开始。

一开始，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）称自己为“四个季节变化，吃饭时吃饭”。在Meipai编辑的建议之后，它变成了“古老的食物”，并且今天仍然使用。

2016年9月，一个新的机会悄悄地出现了，这也成为李Zyu将来更加关注的重要推动者。 Sina Weibo开始公开寻找更多出色的简短视频创建者以获得资源支持。

正如文章开头所述，刘·汤明（Liu Tongming）为她带来了微博的资源支持。

2016年9月的一天，古老的简短视频博客作者Li Feng意外收到了“先生先生的私人微博消息”。 L”。 L先生表达了对李Ziyu的视频内容的热爱，觉得他已经实现了他的作陶王的梦，并希望与她见面。

此后很长一段时间，Li Ziyi收到了L先生的私人信。 “这样一个好视频让这个人看到它是可惜的。这是中国和世界各地的人们应该看到USCHINA骄傲的传统文化。 “先生。我在一条私人消息中说。

起初，在看到这些私人消息后，李Ziyi并不在乎太多，甚至不必担心遇到骗子。直到一天，L先生来到了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）所在的城市，并想请她吃饭和聊天。 L先生的礼貌和清晰的逻辑思维使李慢慢地放弃了最初的警报。

这次偶然的会议彻底改变了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）的生活轨迹。用餐结束后不久，在L先生的帮助下，李·Zizheng（Li Zizheng）得到了Sina Weibo的大量资源的支持，加快了她的知名度，并允许Li Zizhen赶到头部网络影响者的排队。

这种经历部分记录在那年的李Zizheng日记中。一些与温尼安技术高级管理人员接近的内部人士证实了腾讯的“申旺”，即“先生先生L”实际上是刘·汤明（Liu Tongming），他的化名是公开报道的。 Wei Nian Technology的创始人Daxiong Liu是Li Zizhen现在属于的MCN公司。

12月8日，一个标有“是文化产出”的微博主题的阅读量攀升至8亿。李Zizheng再次在热门搜索列表中。

Li Ziyi和她创建的视频现在已成为一个值得研究的现象。

广泛的海外沟通是李齐伊安（Li Zihuan）重新关注的重要原因。有人说她已经拍摄了理想的乡村生活，并传播了中国传统文化和美食的魅力。其他人则认为她的视频并非完全正确地反映中国的乡村生活。

自从爆炸再次提出以来一直很受欢迎的疑问，例如成为DJ，成为富人的第二代，无论是我自己的视频，是否有强烈的推动力，视频是真的对于农村生活，这仍然是角色环境的小说。

Weinian Technology的一位内部人士告诉Tencent的“ Deep Web”，Li Ziyi是普通的，相关的视频内容是由Li Ziyi本人制作的。受欢迎程度不是公司和他本人的倡议。实际上，他背后的李·齐伊安（Li Zihuan）和微读团队都非常低调，他们非常热情，拒绝了当前的所有采访需求。

直到2018年8月17日，Li Ziyi的同名TMALL商店正式开业。上网六天后，当时只有五种产品的商店的销售额超过150,000，销售额超过1000万。一年后，李Zizhen旗舰店展示的21种产品的总销售额超过130万，总销售额达到7100万。
Li Ziyi的IP背后的价值正在迅速挖掘。

Li Ziyi从头开始，并以自己的力量获得了第一批粉丝。但是现在，声名和财富的受欢迎程度和收益显然不再只是她的成就。
根据Tianyan Search的说法，“ Deep Web”表明，Li Ziyi属于的McN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。于2013年2月28日成立，其注册资本为5.208亿元。根据引言，Wei Nian是一家娱乐娱乐公司，通过简短的视频将KOL孵化为IP，并扩展到消费者品牌。

Qixinbao的信息表明，商标“ Li Zihuan”有100多种知识产权信息。申请人公司是Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。产品类别包括食品，服装，鞋子和帽子，染料和脂肪，染料和脂肪，啤酒和饮料，金融物业管理，餐饮和住宿。

不仅如此，Wei Nian还与Li Ziyu的公司建立了不可忽视的联系。

根据眼睛检查，李亚吉亚（应该是李祖的原始名称）于2017年7月20日成立了四川Ziyu文化传播公司有限公司。主管Li Jiajia持有49％的股份。

根据其他数据，Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。的背后有多达50家受益公司，包括Greenland Holdings，ZTE，新华社媒体，Vanke，Light Media等。
在Weinian技术的股东中，Sina Weibo特别引人注目。

从Wei Nian Technology到Sina Weibo，Li Ziyi逐渐拥有互联网名人期待的最佳卡片。
用她自己的话说，她从“有点透明变成了一个对社会无用的人”。在进入公众观点并被更多人注意到之后，李齐的责任感也变得更加重。
“我想尽我所能，做更多对社会有益的事情，例如传统文化，非遗产文化工匠的传播，我想向所有人展示这些旧事物，以便更多的人知道。李Ziyi说。

29466,UgzZzJbuNnUNCMBVlIR4AaABAg.8xjFGku-_Z_8yojVT_eoiA,1,3 years ago,"@paulchen1067 i don't know if it is your understanding of your understanding or not to see it carefully. what i said is ""actually protecting taiwanese netizens and beneficial to taiwan"", not ""to protect taiwan"". although the research and development of firewalls, although it is not subjective to protect taiwan, it objectively protects taiwan and protects taiwan. as for the reasons for the research and development of firewalls, many domestic forums have discussions, which are mainly summarized as:
first, because there are many yellow adult websites outside the wall, these pornographic websites do not have any protection, and children can open it at will. these primary school students who are still studying are not seen. the two children should see these pornographic adult websites when they should not see these things, so it protects my children at least. i am very grateful;
second, many fake news of rumoring and discredited chinese demons outside the wall flies. some people who are not mature are not enough to distinguish. it is easy to be misleading. it is the same as the brainwashing sun flowers in taiwan. the united states. the country is very good at using tools such as the internet and traditional media to combine the right to speak and subvert other countries in combination with the right to speak in the hand. the spring of arabia, which occurred in a series of countries in a series of countries in the middle east, is the united states and other use of the internet hegemony to incite and subvert other countries. the big ""masterpiece"", the current violent turmoil that occurs in hong kong is the same. as long as those who have a little mind and a little international insight can see clearly. assuming that the middle east countries also had comprehensive internet protection measures at that time, they would not be by the united states. using social media such as the internet to easily incite their domestic fighting and turmoil, it ultimately leads to the tragic situation of war, the people's non -talk, refugee flowing, and economic collapse. the history of traditional colonial countries such as the united states and britain used the internet to infiltrate and subvert the country in one day or two. the intelligence department uses the internet and other tools to conduct as many as 39 countries that have infiltrated and subverted other countries. this is what the united states is said in hillary's mouth. china's firewall to a certain extent has a certain blocking effect on this intelligence agency using the internet to incite public opinion and cause social turmoil to ultimately achieve the ""ingenious strength"" of subverting the country's regime. the entire exposure of the eyelids of the anti -chinese countries will be manipulated by the information departments such as the united states, which leads to the chaos in hong kong today. the purpose of trump is to use hong kong as a bargaining chip to the extreme of china to pressure china. in order to eventually occupy more cheap china in the trade war negotiations.
third, in fact, for the consideration of national security, many countries have walls, south korea, and germany, usa, and germany. india envy china to have bat, and it is ready to engage in the wall. after all foreigners, snowden exposed the prism door, especially after the german chancellor merkel's mobile phone was listened to the cia, germany was also building a wall. it seems that this is a trend. the internet has now become a new battlefield. the major countries are developing network troops and building walls crazy, but the forms are different. the united states has long been set off the world in the world. in addition to prism doors, there are also five -eye alliances. the internet world has long been reduced to the colonies in the united states without knowing it. the ability to be capable of capable of has a wall. only those who are unable to build it are going. the american wall is much more advanced than the chinese wall technology. it is difficult to find that this is really a bit embarrassing. in fact, the background is also recording cross -border traffic and even secretly analyzing the content of the mail package. similar words such as ""production"" and ""buying suicide bombs"", and soon, fbi agents came to your house to search. these are keywords and sensitive words monitoring techniques. obviously haha, the chinese wall is a pediatric department compared to the american wall. chinese technology can only monitor itself, and even the technology can not completely make it unable to turn the wall. however, lao and american technology can monitor the world. the gap is really not a little or two, but a generation and two generations.
some people say that china is engaged in net walls to be afraid that domestic people will know what the so -called truth, and the actual situation is exactly the opposite. if you are really afraid of people in the country to know what the so -called ""truth"" and why do you put so more than 100 million domestic in china a year people go out to see ""truth""? can you stop it? are you afraid that more than 100 million people will go out to see the ""truth""? obviously this is conflict. china has more than 150 million people every year, and 130 million foreigners entering china have become the world's largest in the world. one of the tourist destinations, as many as 10 million foreigners living in china, as many as 60 million chinese people living abroad, hundreds of foreign embassies and consulates in china, more than 100,000 foreign media resident reporters, there are more than 10 million international multinational companies and foreign trade companies are held in hundreds of international conferences and large -scale activities in china each year. after 40 years of opening up, china has already been integrated into the world in all aspects. in the era of information such in information, everyone can spread through the global era when everyone picks up a mobile phone, saying that the idea of โ€โ€being afraid of people know what ""truth"" is really naive, and it also proves how ridiculous the guessing people who want to eat melon for granted. essence
the fourth is to protect the growth and growth of its own internet industry. do not want to be occupied by american companies like the same domestic internet as the world. the top ten important network industries in the world are either the united states or in mainland china, and they have begun to enter the global market. the top ten internet companies in the world, each of which each country and the united states are half. other countries are zero. some people once said that there are only two world internet countries. the united states and china (this is permanently set in wuzhen, zhejiang, zhejiang, china. to. mainland china โ€s internet strength is second in the world. although the overall strength is still far behind the united states, it is the only country that is comparable to the united states in the internet field. the european union, india, russia, canada, japan, australia cannot do it, because of the degree of pain, the market, the market, the population, the population, the funds, the language, the policy, the technology, culture, etc. when we laughed at this firewall, we did not know that only from politics, the vision of thinking was so narrow, and the sour people's vision was like a rat, foolish. the internet achievement of the walls of the wall in china is: we have created a set of our own network industry chain, the second largest in the world. and when netizens all over the world brush fb and yt every day, when google's hou, they did not realize that their countries, including some european countries, have become ""colonies"" in the united states of the united states, not only the online market and public opinion were facebook, but they were facebook. foreign network power control dominates other foreign network power control, and the people of their domestic companies must also pay expensive advertising fees and usage fees. and all the personal data of their national and enterprises, all of which are stored in the server of the us internet company giants, have long been safe. in the past two years, fackbook has repeatedly gone out the incidents of leakage of their personal information information and selling. it is one of the proof.
the fifth is to facilitate the management of the network and crack down on cyber crimes. the internet is the same as a real society. every day, a lot of criminal activities are filled with criminal activities. some of them have subverted the country, illegal operations, and criminal criminals, such as online fraud, money laundering, online gambling, mlm, cult transmission ... and police officers in a country it can only be enforced in its own country because of the multinational nature of the internet. if criminals set up the server abroad, and criminal activities such as fraud on ordinary people in the country, the police can only watch them implement criminal crimes against domestic abroad. there is no way to manage it. this is not a good thing for the interests of ordinary people. this wall can filter most of this kind of overseas fraud, gambling, money laundering, etc. most filtering can increase the difficulty of crime of overseas criminal criminals, which is valuable. ordinary people do nโ€t care about turning over the wall, and they do nโ€t touch the law. for example, college students write papers to check foreign language information, etc., and 99%of chinese resources are on the internet in the country. the chinese content outside the wall is added. there are more than 1%. compared to those who do not understand foreign languages, the wall is the real sea. it is just a small puddle on the wall. i am not proficient in foreign languages. individuals are proficient in a foreign language, so there is no great impact on the wall. besides, this firewall does not block all foreign websites outside, but just block part of the content of the country and the people. many foreign websites can be accessed directly. domestic ipv6 users, and some campus networks. education network can directly access foreign websites. many domestic websites, including apps, can also be accessed directly from abroad, such as weibo, douyin, and douyin, douyin, douyin, and douyin, douyin, and douyin, douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin. douban ... you can access it directly from abroad, and the firewall is not intercepted by a knife. there are so many embassies, multinational companies, foreign trade companies, foreign -related institutions, universities, and research institutions. this number is an astronomical figure. so many people are legally used to use external networks for daily work and business. even the official cctv in china is on yt. with the official channel, it can be seen that the role of the firewall is not to block the network and outside the network. the function is obviously filtering, filtering out those things that are harmful to national security and the interests of the people, and retaining beneficial things. a person is sick alone. everyone knows to go to the hospital to see a doctor. when you take medicine and take medicine, you have to remove the germs that endanger your body to keep your body healthy. why can't the internet be filtered out of those bad things and keep the internet be healthy. in short, weighing the advantages and disadvantages and comprehensive considerations, li yuan is more than disadvantaged.
the above just means that i am not ""refuted for refutation."" everyoneโ€s iq, eq, experience, observation, and international vision are different. the depth and breadth of thinking are different, but one thing must be remembered. that is, don't float in the appearance, don't want to be cloudy, but get rid of prejudice and settings, think independently, and approach the essence and truth. in this way, you can truly achieve ""not confused"" without being stupid. break and use.","@paulchen1067 不知道是你的理解力问题还是看得不仔细，我说的是“实际上保护了台湾网民，对台湾有利”，不是说“为了保护台湾”。研发防火墙，主观上虽然不是为了保护台湾，但客观上保护了台湾，既“实际上”保护了台湾。 至于研发防火墙的原因，国内很多论坛上都有讨论，主要归纳为几点： 
一是因为墙外很多黄色成人网站，这些色情网站没有任何防护，小朋友都可以随意点开，这些总不能让那些还在念书的小学生初中生等小朋友看到才对吧，反正我是不希望我家的两个小朋友在不该看到这些东西的年龄看到这些色情成人网站的，所以它至少保护了我家的小孩，我是很感激的； 
第二，墙外很多造谣抹黑妖魔化中国的假新闻满天飞，有些年纪不大还不成熟的人思考力分辨力还不够，很容易被误导就跟台湾那些被洗脑的太阳花觉青一样，美国等国家非常擅长利用互联网和传统媒体等工具结合手中控制的舆论话语权对他国进行意识形态的渗透和颠覆，发生在中东一系列国家的阿拉伯之春就是美国等利用互联网霸权煽动颠覆它国的一大“杰作”，目前发生在香港的暴力动乱也是如此，只要稍微有点脑子有点国际洞察力的人都看得一清二楚，假设当时中东国家也拥有完善的互联网保护措施，也就不会被美国等利用互联网等社交媒体轻易就煽动其国内的内斗和动乱，最终导致如今这些国家战火纷飞、民不聊生、难民流离、经济崩溃的惨状。美英等传统殖民国家利用互联网对它国进行渗透颠覆的历史可不是一天两天了，从乌克兰到摩洛哥，从利比亚到叙利亚，从埃及再到委内瑞拉，据维基解密统计，冷战结束后，美国CIA等情报部门利用互联网等工具对它国进行渗透颠覆搞掉的国家多达39个，这就是希拉里口中所说的美国的“巧实力""吧，毕竟美国掌握着全球互联网霸权和舆论话语权，而中国的防火墙在一定程度上对这种情报机关利用网络进行舆论煽动和造成社会动荡最终达到颠覆别国政权的“巧实力”有一定的阻挡作用，而香港正是因为互联网过于开放，毫不设防，整个暴露在反中国家的眼皮底下，才会被美国等情报部门随意操弄，导致今日香港乱局，而特朗普的目的正是要将香港搞乱作为向中国极限施压的一个筹码，以便于最终在贸易战谈判中占到中国更多便宜。 
第三，实际上出于国家安全的考虑，很多国家都有墻，韩国有，美国俄国德国都有，印度羡慕中国有BAT，也准备要搞墙了，泰国防部建立“天网” 追踪境内全部外国人，斯诺登曝光棱镜门后，尤其是德国总理默克尔的手机被美国中情局监听后，德国也在筑墙，看来这是趋势，网路现在已经成了一个全新的战场，各大国都在发展网络部队，疯狂筑墙，只是形式不一样而已，而美国，早就在全世界布下了天罗地网，除了棱镜门，还有五眼联盟，监视全世界，完全没设防的国家，网络世界早就沦为了美国的殖民地而不自知，有能力的国家基本都有墻，没能力建设的就只有随它去了，而美国的墻比中国的墻技术先进多了，一般人都很难发现，这个确实有点屌，其实后台一样在记录跨境流量甚至暗中抓取邮件包内容自动分析，发邮件人一点感觉都没有，在美国境内上网发表“刺杀特朗普”""轰炸白宫""或“制作”“购买自杀式炸弹”等类似字眼，很快就有FBI的探员来你家敲门搜查了，这些都是关键词、敏感词的监听技术，不像中国的墙简单粗暴，太明显了哈哈，中国墻跟美国墻相比就是小儿科，中国的技术只能监控自己，甚至技术还达不到完全让网民无法翻墙哈，但老美的技术却能监控全世界，中美的技术水平差距真的不是一点两点，而是一代两代。 
有人说中国搞网墙是为了怕国内的人知道什么所谓的真相，实际情况正好相反，如果真是怕国内的人知道什么所谓的“真相”，那干嘛每年还放那么多一亿多国内的人出去看“真相""？挡得住么？不怕这一亿多人出去看到“真相”么，显然这是自相矛盾的，中国每年出国人数一亿五千多万人次，入境中国的外国人1.2亿人次，中国已成为全球最大的旅游目的国之一，在中国生活的外国人高达一千多万，居住在国外的华人高达六千多万，中国常驻有数百个外国使领馆，十多万国外媒体常驻记者，有一千多万家国际跨国公司和外贸公司，每年在中国有数百场国际会议和大型活动召开，历经40年的开放，中国早已全方位深度融入了全球，每年这么多与世界的联系与互动，在资讯这么发达，人人拿起手机随手一拍就能传遍全球的时代，说怕人知道什么“真相”的想法真的极其幼稚，也证明国内那些想当然的吃瓜群众的猜测显得多么荒谬。 
第四，是为了保护国内自己的互联网產业的成长壮大，不希望跟全世界一样国内的互联网全被美国公司佔领。全世界排名前十的重要网络产业，不是美国的就是中国大陆的，而且开始进军全球市场。全球十大互联网公司，中美各占一半，其它国家为零，有人曾言，世界互联网大国只有两个，美国和中国（这点从世界互联网大会会址永久定在中国浙江乌镇就不难看出）。中国大陆互联网实力全球第二，虽然整体实力仍远远落后于美国，却是唯一在互联网领域有机会媲美美国的国家。欧盟，印度，俄罗斯，加拿大，日本，澳大利亚都做不到，因为痛合度，市场，幅员，人口，资金，语言，政策，技术，文化，等等各种因素。当我们在嘲笑这个防火墙的时候，殊不知，只从政治看问题，眼界思维如此之狭隘，酸民眼光如鼠、愚不可及。在中国这设墙的二十多年的互联网成果是：我们打造了一套属于自己的网络产业链，全球第二大。而当全世界的网民每天在刷着FB、YT，谷歌的时侯，他们完全没有意识到自己国家包括一些欧洲国家已经沦为网络经济强国美国的“殖民地”，不仅网络市场和舆论被Facebook、Yahoo、Google等外来网络强权控制主导，其本国企业要接触自己的民众还必须支付昂贵的广告费和使用费等等费用。而把自己国家国民和企业的个人资料，隐私等全部储存在美国互联网公司巨头的服务器里，早已毫无安全可言，过去两年Fackbook公司多次暴出将其用户个人信息资料泄漏出卖的事件便是明证之一。 
第五，是为了便于网络的管理，打击网络犯罪。网络和现实社会一样，每天充斥着大量的犯罪活动，有颠覆国家的，非法营运的，还有刑事犯罪的，比如网络诈骗，洗钱，网络赌博，传销，邪教传播这些……而一个国家的警察只能在其本国境内执法，因为网络的跨国性，如果刑事犯罪分子把服务器架设在国外，而对国内的普通民众进行诈骗等犯罪活动，警察只能眼睁睁看着他们在境外实施对国内的犯罪，却没办法管得到，这对普通百姓的利益绝非好事，而这堵墙能过滤掉大部分这种境外诈骗、赌博、洗钱等针对国内民众的犯罪，虽然不能完全百分百过滤，但过滤大部分，能增加境外跨境刑事犯罪分子的犯罪难度，已经难能可贵了。普通人没事翻翻墙不会管，而且也不触法，比如 大学生写论文翻墙查外文资料等，而99%的中文资源都在境内的互联网上，墻外的中文內容加起來也沒有墻內的1%多，相對于不懂外语的人來說，墻內才是真正的大海，墻上只是一個小水坑而已，不熟练掌握外语，你翻出來也是來到了一片沙漠，因为并不是每个人都精通一门外语的，所以翻不了墙并没有什么太大的影响，况且这个防火墙并不是把所有外国网站全部挡在外面，而只是把一部分的对国家和百姓利益有害的内容拦在外面，国外很多网站是可以直接访问的，国内IPV6用户，还有一些校园网，教育网都是可以直接访问国外网站的，国内很多网站包括APP也可以从国外直接访问，比如微博、抖音、豆瓣......等都可以从国外直接访问，防火墙并没有一刀切地拦截。国内那么多大使馆、跨国公司、外贸公司，涉外机构、高校、研究机构，这数字是个天文数字，这么多人都在合法地使用外网进行日常工作和业务，连国内官方的央视都在YT上开了官方频道，可见防火墙的作用并不是要阻断网内和网外，其功能显然在于过滤，过滤掉了那些对国家安全和百姓利益有害的东西，保留了有益的东西，一个人生病了都知道去医院看医生，打针吃药甚至做手术都要除掉危害身体的病菌让身体保持健康，为什么互联网就不能过滤掉那些坏的东西让网络保持良性健康呢。 总之，权衡利弊，综合考虑的话，利远大于弊。 
以上，只是说明我并不是“为反驳而反驳”，每个人的智商、情商、阅历、观察力、国际视野都不一样，思维的深度、广度也不一样，但有一点是必须记住的，即不要浮于表象，不要人云亦云，而是摆脱成见和定势，独立思考，接近本质与真相，这样，才能真正达到“不惑”，且不会被愚蠢的自以为是绑架，更不会被他人的言辞蛊惑和利用。"

under so many pressure, she had to move with her grandma to a much more remote place so that people can not find them. she suffered so many difficulties and finally achieved success but she still continues living and surviving, try to express the most beautiful scenery for us to watch. i really wanna appreciate all the hard work you did and every updated video represents an increasing quality. 


don't get injured, take care of yourself, you already did good enough, your videos motivated so many people all around the world, you overcome the language barrier and show the world the best of your life and china. as a chinese person, i really wanna say thank you.","我想介绍Ziqi的一些背景，让人们对她的了解得更好。她出生于中国四川省。实际上，她小时候遇到了很多困难，父亲早就死了，母亲离开了她，她的祖母长大了。由于她的家人非常贫穷，因此由于她负担不起钱，因此她离开了学校。她去了城市，做了很多艰苦的工作，但是当奶奶的健康状况不佳时，她辞去了工作，决定搬回祖母的村庄。她开始从事自我键盘的业务来赚钱，但起初这并没有成功，但是当中国短视频行业发展时，她开始制作第一家中国古老的食品美食，该视频吸引了很多人值得关注。尽管她取得了更大的成功，但似乎在网上反对声音，但他们认为她用不同的人表演，并且有一支庞大的团队来编辑这些视频。最糟糕的是，有些人甚至在她的房子里设置了相机，以查看射击过程是否是假的。


在这么多的压力下，她不得不和祖母一起搬到一个更偏远的地方，以便人们找不到它们。她遇到了很多困难，并最终取得了成功，但她仍然继续生活和生存，试图表达我们最美丽的风景。我真的很想欣赏您所做的所有辛勤工作，每个更新的视频都代表着质量的提高。


不要受伤，照顾好自己，您已经做得足够好了，您的视频激发了世界各地的许多人，您克服了语言障碍，并向世界展示了您的生活和中国。作为一个中国人，我真的想说谢谢。"

so sad that chinese in china does not have right to say to no to the government.
chinese in other countries opened their eyes that chinese government is oppressing their citizens to manipulate their mind about china number 1, china strong, china everything, but the fact is chinese in china is just blinded by their own government.
don't get me wrong. one of my best friend is chinese and he is in usa. he clearly does not think like chinese in china. ask chinese outside of china. most who lived long enough away from china will say the true. those who still say china is everything is the sad reality that people still under no total govern control, culture, media, education and most importantly the truth.","YouTube在中国大陆被政府正式禁止。她能够与许多订户一起访问YouTube的事实是，中国政府支持她促进错误的文化事实，以传播“一切都来自中国”的错误思想。

let's understand the culture that began in the country on the mainland when there was a country in china and the culture that started in china.
in summary, it can be said that it is the top 10 civilizations of the mainland.
that is the plague (pest), foot binding, burning books, confucianism, mao zedong, cultural revolution, tiananmen revolution, sars (sars), huangsha, wuhan pneumonia (covid-19), fake imitation row.

the four major inventions advocated by modern china or most of the culture of china called the originator of their originator are false, or the culture of other countries, and advocate that china is the originator.
regardless of the past mainland countries and modern china, people's minds are empty.
in particular, the recent chinese people have been cross -wisdom by the communist party, and they have lost their wisdom of independent judgment.
therefore, they really believe that the communist party's false institutional is shouting the communist party every day, and china is the world's highest country.
the chinese who lived with the slavery of the communist party felt very desolate.
however, there is no need to feel pitiful or regretful, because the chinese are very happy because they do not realize their own situation.
so outsiders have no reason to destroy their happiness.

there are very few chinese people who know the heroes of chinese heroes mao zedong, and even those who know they dare not say.

mao zedong is a lascivious. he especially likes a 10 -year -old girl who is not adults and women.
it is said that the older women knew too much about the world and said that there was no innocence.
moreover, it is said that a woman who likes to have husbands, especially the low education level with low education level.
when he was in his 70s, in the local guidance, there was a husband who was in his early 20s. after asking the name, mao zedong wrote his name on the manual. dongxing encouraged the husband of the husband to divorce and dedicated it to mao zedong.
it is said that he and a husband who had a husband gave birth to a few illegitimate children.

mao zedong's sexual desire is very strong, and he is basic to his wife. he has a sexually transmitted disease and melamine disease.
therefore, women who have sex with mao zedong have this disease.
but those women were proud of the disease.
at that time, mao zedong, who was worshiped in china at the same time as the living god, was in the same bed, which was a very proud thing in itself.
instead, the facts of being infected with mao zedong's sexually transmitted diseases are used as a medal. this phenomenon can be said to be crazy.

mao zedong has never washed his genitals in his life.
once, his attending doctor li zhisui mentioned health issues. mao zedong said: ""i have been bathing in a woman's body, so it doesn't matter.""
not only that, the body itself did not clean it, and the river people wiped them with a wet towel.

mao zedong's tooth health is really bad, there is no brushing, and a bit of bitter tea from chinese tea often instead of brushing your teeth with bitter tea. a lot of.

@cannot be managed by this image to manage their own leaders, the chaotic leaders in private life, and the chinese brain of the chinese who regard the people who regard the people as a hero.
the chinese do have serious mental illness.
they should be locked in mainland china and should not let them come to the world to pollute the earth.
china is a malignant tumor of the earth, and the chinese are cancer cells that torture the earth.
therefore, in order to prevent the earth's disaster, all the chinese must be located in mainland china.","@亚洲大陆东部的国家(现在中国)10大文明。
让我们来了解一下大陆上存在中国以前的国家时开始的文化和现在始于中国的文化。
综合起来，可以说是大陆起源的10大文明。
那个是鼠疫(PEST)、缠足、 焚书坑儒、毛泽东、文化大革命、天安门革命、非典(SARS)、黄沙、武汉肺炎(COVID-19)、假货模仿排场。

现代中国主张的4大发明品或中国称其鼻祖的大部分文化是假的，或者偷窃其他国家的文化，主张中国是鼻祖。
无论是过去的大陆国家，还是现代的中国，人们的头脑都是空空的。
特别是最近的中国人被共产党所弩化，丧失了自主判断的智慧。
因此，他们真的相信共产党的虚假煽动，天天喊着共产党万岁，中国是世界最高的国家。
以这种共产党的奴隶生活的中国人感到非常凄凉。
但是，没有必要对此感到可怜或惋惜，这是因为中国人没有意识到自己的这种处境而感到非常幸福。
所以外人没有理由破坏他们的幸福。

@了解中国人英雄毛泽东现实的中国人很少，即使是知道的人也不敢说出口。

毛泽东是个好色之徒，特别喜欢不是成人女性的10多岁少女。
据说，上了年纪的女子们对世事过于了解，而且说没有纯真的味道。
而且据说喜欢有夫之妇，特别是喜欢教育水平较低的纯朴的农村妇女。
70多岁的时候，在当地指导时，有一个20岁出头的有夫之妇，毛泽东在问完名字后，在手册上写上自己的名字，非常喜欢，看到此情此景的心腹汪东兴怂恿有夫之妇的丈夫离婚，并献给了毛泽东。
据说他和有夫之妇生下了几个私生子。

毛泽东性欲很旺盛，对妻子不伦不类是基本，患有一种性病，三聚氰胺的疾病。
因此，与毛泽东发生性关系的女人都得了这种病。
但是那些女人反而为得了那个病而自豪。
当时与中国崇拜得如同活生生的神一样的毛泽东同床共枕，这本身就是一件非常值得骄傲的事情。
反而把一起感染毛泽东性病的事实当作一种勋章，这种现象可以说是疯了。

毛泽东一辈子都没有亲手洗过自己的生殖器。
有一次，他的主治医生李志绥提到卫生问题，毛泽东说:""一直在女人的体内洗澡，所以没关系。"" 
不仅如此，身体本身也没有洗干净，河人们用湿毛巾擦身。

毛泽东的牙齿健康确实很糟糕，没有刷牙，而且经常喝中国茶的一种苦茶，用苦茶代替刷牙，所以牙齿健康非常不好，牙石和食物残渣很多，牙龈都积满了脓，蛀牙也很多。

@不能用这种形象管理自己的领导人、私生活混乱的领导人、把百姓视为自己玩物力的领导人视为英雄的中国人的大脑，不能不说是研究对象。
中国人确实患有严重的精神病。
应该把他们关在中国大陆，不应该让他们来到世界污染地球。
中国是地球的恶性肿瘤，中国人是折磨地球的癌细胞。
因此，要想阻止地球发生大灾难，必须将中国人全部关到死为止中国大陆内。"

还有，西北沙漠地区的绿化覆盖率正在这几年快速提高，你可以在卫星地图看到。习近平有句话叫“绿水青山，就是金山银山”。包括在气候变化大会的积极响应（反观美国退出巴黎气候协议）现在中国正在改变，西方国家媒体看多了自然会改变你的想法，多去中国走走会改变你的想法。"

万里长城、孔子、旗袍在历史上都是韩国的文化。 孔子出生在韩国的庆州，有韩国血统的父母，万里长城是韩国人为保护韩半岛免遭敌人袭击而建造的。 旗袍也是韩服中变形的衣服。 韩国人想打扮的时候穿韩服，睡觉的时候没有格调的场合穿旗袍。 现在可以看到中国的少数民族穿旗袍，那是借着很久之前的韩国文化维持至今的。

as many as 10 million dogs are believed to be killed for their meat annually in china, with up to 10,000 killed for the yulin festival, according to the washington-based humane society. while much of the meat comes through legitimate farms, many dog slaughterhouses are run privately and secretively to avoid scrutiny by food-safety inspectors.

as for why it is not optimistic, the reason is actually very simple, because there are always some people who always want to be the kneeling people in other countries and the nobles of their own country. these people have no backbone. they are born to kneel and lick their dogs. unfortunately, they died early in the morning, and it became difficult. this incident has become more difficult since chairman mao said on september 21, 1949 that ""the chinese people have stood up"". but today there are still some people who have no shame on their knees. they are confused and angry about the chinese people standing around them, so they roar at the chinese people standing up. master yang stands up! you still don't come back and kneel! you can't do it! you can't stand up! ""when they found that the chinese people stood indifferently about it, they said it's not okay, or that, it's not optimistic or optimistic. they forgot that slaves were slaves. the natural knees could not become nobles. they forgot that the slave's face is used to fight. whoever is optimistic or not, it doesn't matter. don't delay us. it can be tolerated or not.","我们这个国家、这个党派，从来就有人不看好，也不需要谁都看好。因为这个国家从来不属于那些看的人，只属于踏踏实实去努力建设的人。你看不看好没关系，你看不看也没关系，我只踏踏实实的去做我的事，完成一个一个的五年计划。五年计划就像一个接力棒，接过来传下去，大家努力的传递着，一直到了今天，一个强大的中国还在成长着。
至于为什么不看好，其实原因很简单，因为总 有那么一些人，老想着当别的国家的跪族、自己国家的贵族。这些人是没有脊梁的，天生的会跪会舔狗仗人势的奴才相，可惜啊，大清早亡了，这事变得困难了。从1949年9月21日毛主席说过「中国人民站起来了」以后，这事变得更加困难了。但是时至今日还是有那么一些人，跪的踏踏实实丝毫不觉羞耻，对他们身边站起来的中国人民有着困惑与愤怒，于是冲着站起来的中国人民吼叫着「你们怎么敢在洋大人洋老爷们跟前站起来!你们还不回来跪着!你 们是不行的!你们是不能站起来的!」 当他们发现中国人民对此无动于衷的站着的时候，他们又说站不长久的，数落着这也不行那也不行，这也不看好那也不看好。他们忘了，奴才就是奴才，天生的跪族，成不了贵族。他们忘了，奴才的脸就是用来打的，谁看不看好、看不看，都不重要，别耽误我们做事就行。是可忍孰不可忍，前车之鉴，勿谓言之不预也"

when i said, 'knowing i shouldn't, if you are right....', i meant that i wouldn't disrespect or disregard or be ignorant of the hurt it might cause people who know the truth, whatever it may be, since i have no access to it, which is why, the former comment was followed by my desire of confirmation. don't conveniently choose to see one part and ignore the other. 
i can see your point that the subtitles are inconsistently strewn over videos, and had it been truly propaganda, it would have been differently so. wish you had said it sooner. 
as for me asking you to read the thread, i truly believed you didn't. since your comment about semantics was wrongly placed. i was talking about my language. however, i didn't mean to condescend to you, and if you felt bad about it, then i apologize. hope you will accept it. if you feel that, that was my intention, let me assure you it wasn't. and no, i don't mean that just because you belong from china, i see all chinese people that way. you have absolutely no grounds to base that upon. i merely enquired about it. and i am having a reasonably calm discussion with a stranger on a dangerous virtual platform, does that indicate that i am putting everyone in the same category? as for technology, i know for a fact that she has an imac, a professional editing machine. she edits her own videos. before you twist that as well, let me make it clear that she doesn't do it on her phone, is all i am saying. i can't help but feel like a lot of your feelings about my comments are culled from your perception of how the world sees china. and please stop seeing it from the angle that i am criticizing her videos. i can't press enough on the fact that i never did. i am very glad to know that she is a positive source of inspiration for the people of china. so please, i insist you stop dragging that cat through the mortar. i have been courteous to you, and apologized if your sentiments were hurt. i will have to request you stop misinterpreting my every word. and you did read things that you wanted to read. since i didn't mean them, i know i am speaking the truth. 
yes, every country does try to promote itself, and i will wager that a lot of it is actually propaganda. my country does it, so does the others. the difference is that the people have a right to prove them wrong on a public platform. we have the right to criticize them openly and call them on their misrepresentation. and here, the remark is about the government, not your culture or people. 
finally, i will reiterate that my intention was not to hurt your feelings. you think there was an ulterior motive. there wasn't. you think that i think the apples don't fall far from the tree. i don't. and my deduction was just that, presence of a crew. that could indicate a joint project of a political nature, but in this case, as you rightly suggested, it doesn't, since the subtitles are spare. 

now, i am tired of explaining things again and again. i hope you understand. and good day.","@DesignQQQ8905 hmm。好吧，我看到我的评论在哪里唱歌。让我清楚地表明您正在阅读很多东西。不，我并不是说，如果我看到中国的联合项目，我应该得出这样的结论：这是宣传。那是您的解释，希望您在看到错误时会承认自己的错误。因为那不是我的意思。

我可以看到您的观点是，字幕在视频上不一致，如果确实是宣传，那将是不同的。希望您早日说。
至于我要你阅读线程，我真的相信你没有。由于您对语义的评论被错误地放置了。我在谈论我的语言。但是，我并不是要屈服于您，如果您对此感到难过，那我深表歉意。希望你会接受。如果您觉得那是我的意图，让我向您保证不是。不，我并不是说仅仅因为您属于中国，我都会看到所有中国人。您绝对没有理由以此为基础。我只是询问它。而且我正在与一个危险的虚拟平台上的陌生人进行相当平静的讨论，这是否表明我将每个人都属于同一类别？至于技术，我知道她拥有一台专业编辑机器的iMac。她编辑自己的视频。我只说，在您扭转这一点之前，让我清楚地表明她不在手机上做到这一点。我忍不住想像您对世界如何看待中国的看法，您对我的评论的许多感觉都被淘汰了。并且请不要从我批评她的视频的角度看到它。我从未做过的事实不足。我很高兴知道她是中国人民的积极灵感。所以，我坚持要你停止将那只猫拖到砂浆上。我对你很有礼貌，如果你的情绪受伤，道歉。我将不得不要求您停止误解我的每个单词。您确实阅读了想阅读的东西。由于我不是他们的意思，所以我知道我在说实话。
是的，每个国家都试图提升自己，我会敢打赌，其中很多实际上都是宣传。我的国家也这样做，其他人也这样做。不同之处在于，人们有权在公共平台上证明他们是错误的。我们有权公开批评他们，并致电他们的虚假陈述。在这里，言论是关于政府的，而不是您的文化或人民。
最后，我将重申我的意图不是伤害您的感受。您认为存在别有用心。没有。您认为我认为苹果不会落在树上。我不。我的推论就是，船员的存在。这可能表明一个政治性质的联合项目，但是在这种情况下，正如您正确建议的那样，这不是，因为字幕是备用的。

shouldn't you questioning about what you have been told by the western media now? you are so self-righteous to say people are worldview distorted and brainwashed bla bla by only knowing that i'm a chinese and i speak for china. look who is brainwashed now? i think a mature adult should know to see things dialectically. we or i never say that xi made himself president for life is right or good. actually we were very upset with this even though we know that chinese political system is originally not democratic. but after thinking about the time when all my americans friends had to choose a worse president out of the worst, and the time when the british ordinary voted for brexit but was shocked by the result because they were suppose to vote it for fun, i do think that it might not be a bad thing. because ordinary people have no idea what and who they are voting(americans votes for what they have been promised by the candidates, but god knows if the promises can really became real. most of the time they are fulled by the candidates, or in the end the voted president didn't make his promise come true if though they might want to keep his promises). if xi is a good president and can lead the chinese to better economy and a more united country, why could let him be a life president? i know you would start your noble democracy literature like other westerners. but fuck off democracy! democracy is not the only right way to run a country. actually, is democracy a right way is a good question as well. look at how the democracy has decreased or stopped the economy in most western countries! even america, look at how old their highways are and the terrible road conditions; the average annually income hasn't change much in 10 years, not even mentioning other western countries. they are falling. i like what the former president of singapore lee kuan yew said: countries like us who need to catch up do not need democracy. we have to gather our resources and use it to one and only goal. that is what suitable for us. and now look at what a marvelous country he managed to build from nothing! no homeless, super safe society with diverse culture and people from different background. thus your democracy doesn't work and suits others. don't be bully judging others by thinking only your way is the right way. that is very immature thought. but you are not immature in only that aspect, look at how funny you said about nathan rich. he said things you didn't familiar but contradict to what you thought then you said this person has no integrity but just to please the chinese. why do you stop trying to be a truth-fighter now by criticizing about his content but instead to attack this person? cause you know you don't have the ability to say it out loud that what he had said was unreal. you want to but you cannot.only i and other who truly have ever lived in china can have that right to say if what he said is true or fake. we were arguing if the content in the western media is true or not right? why come to nathan rich's videos, you switched to just subjectively judging a person instead of arguing the objective video contents? so stop lecturing about your so called ""freedom of speech"" cause it's actually not existing in america either. youtube's algorithms has set limits to the reviews of videos which contents the authority don't want you to see. so don't be childish, believe what you have seen by your real eyes. that's why i recommend nathan rich's videos cause the chinese current situations described by him is the one i know of and experienced. i live outside china but i do go back every now and then. i worked and lived in the states from 2012-2018 in a world top tech company having top 5-10% american annually income, but i still feel the huge problems of american society. the extreme white left politicians, the stupid law of letting the criminals to go away if the assets amount they get from robbery or stealing is under $975, the unavoidable frequent car window broking robbery, the drug problem, the disgusting streets of sf with homeless and their shits. your democracy just don't work that well, ok? just accept the truth that not everyone want this and they can live a good life without this. after my american greencard application got current, i had to make a choice if i really wanted to live here and raised my child in a society like this. our answer was no and my family voted by our own feet--we moved out of the states. so all the above came from a person who had really lived in both china and america, sorry to let you down and snapped your face about your brainwashed and worldview distorted conclusion. but if you insist by saying this poor chinese is just so deeply brainwashed even your great truth teller western media couldn't save her back in 7 years, feel free to say so.",@oc-cpa终于在回复的最后一个回复中提出了一个很好的问题吗？是的，为什么一个没有言论自由或新闻自由的痛苦的中国人甚至会出现在本网站上？您现在不应该质疑西方媒体所告诉您的内容吗？您是如此自以为是，以至于人们只知道我是中国人，而我为中国说话，人们就被世界观扭曲和洗脑了。看谁现在被洗脑了？我认为一个成熟的成年人应该知道辩证的事情。我们或我从未说过习近平使自己终身总统是正确的。实际上，即使我们知道中国政治制度本来不是民主的，我们对此感到非常沮丧。但是，在考虑了我所有的美国人朋友都必须从最糟糕的情况下选择更糟糕的总统的时间，而英国普通人投票赞成英国脱欧，但对结果感到震惊，因为他们本来应该投票赞成娱乐，我确实如此认为这可能不是一件坏事。因为普通人不知道他们在投票的是什么（美国人都投票赞成候选人所承诺的东西，但上帝知道承诺是否真的可以变得真实。在大多数情况下，他们都被候选人或在结束选票的总统不会做出他的诺言，尽管他们可能想兑现他的诺言）。如果习近平是一名好总统，可以带领中国人走向更好的经济和更加统一的国家，为什么让他成为终身总统？我知道您会像其他西方人一样开始您的崇高民主文学。但是，滚蛋民主！民主并不是经营一个国家的唯一正确方法。实际上，民主是正确的方法也是一个很好的问题。看看大多数西方国家的民主如何减少或阻止经济！甚至美国，看看他们的高速公路年龄多大和可怕的道路状况。每年的平均收入在10年内没有变化太大，甚至没有提及其他西方国家。他们跌倒了。我喜欢新加坡前总统李·库恩（Lee Kuan Yew）所说的：像我们这样的国家，需要赶上的国家不需要民主。我们必须收集我们的资源，并将其用于一个唯一的目标。那就是适合我们的。现在看看他设法从一无所有地建立了一个奇妙的国家！没有各种文化和来自不同背景的人的无家可归，超级安全的社会。因此，您的民主不起作用并适合他人。不要通过仅思考自己的方式来欺负他人是正确的方法。那是非常不成熟的想法。但是，您并不是在这方面并不成熟，请看看您对Nathan Rich的说法有多有趣。他说您不熟悉的事情，但与您的想法相矛盾，然后您说这个人没有诚信，而只是为了取悦中国人。为什么您现在不再试图通过批评他的内容而试图成为真相战斗机，而要攻击这个人？因为您知道您没有能力大声说出他所说的是虚幻的。您想，但您不能。只有我和其他曾经住在中国的人可以说他说的是真的还是假的。我们在争论西方媒体中的内容是正确的吗？为什么要参加内森·里奇（Nathan Rich）的视频，您改用了主观评判一个人而不是争论客观视频内容？因此，不要再对您所谓的“言论自由”进行讲授，因为它实际上也不存在于美国。 YouTube的算法已设定了视频评论的限制，该视频内容不希望您看到。因此，不要幼稚，相信您的真实眼睛所看到的。这就是为什么我推荐内森·里奇（Nathan Rich）的视频，原因是他所描述的中国当前情况是我知道和经历的。我住在中国以外，但我不时地回去。从2012年至2018年，我在一家世界顶级科技公司中工作并居住在美国，每年获得5-10％的美国收入，但我仍然感到美国社会的巨大问题。极端白人左派政客，如果他们从抢劫或偷窃的资产金额不到975美元，那是让罪犯离开的愚蠢法律，这是不可避免的经常发生的车窗经纪抢劫，毒品问题，令人恶心他们的狗屎。您的民主制度不太好，好吗？只要接受并非每个人都想要这个的事实，没有这个，他们就可以过上美好的生活。在我的美国绿色申请中申请后，如果我真的想住在这里并在这样的社会中抚养我的孩子，我必须做出选择。我们的回答是否定的，我的家人用自己的脚投票 - 我们搬出了美国。因此，以上所有内容都来自一个真正生活在中国和美国的人，很抱歉让您失望，并为您的洗脑和世界观扭曲了结论。但是，如果您坚持说这个可怜的中国人被深深地洗脑了，即使您的伟大真相teller teller teller媒体无法在7年内拯救她，请随时这样说。
