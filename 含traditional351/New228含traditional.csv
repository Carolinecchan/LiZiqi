10991,UgzVXwN2Sk-mZ8X4ecJ4AaABAg,5,2 years ago,"if you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about liziqi ( li ziyi ): 

in 1990, li ziyi fell to the ground in mianyang, sichuan. her parents divorced when she was very young. later, her father died, and li ziyi became an orphan. his stepmother didnโ€t treat her well. li zizhen mentioned on weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten. 

grandpa and grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take li ziyu home and live. when li ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. at the age of 14, li ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. her first life was very hard. she slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months. 

li ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. in order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. later, when talking about the matter, li zizhen frankly said: โ€i didnโ€t say that i liked music at that time, just to live, i felt that it was well paid.โ€ 

in 2012, because grandma was ill once, li ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. โ€being closer, i feel more at ease.โ€ 

after returning, li ziyi opened a taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. in 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, li ziyi was exposed to the short video platform meipai. until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of taobao business, li ziyi re-entered meipai to prepare for his own video program. 

the reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment. 

in an interview with the living room of sina club, li ziyi mentioned, โ€all these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. in the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places. 

in the beginning, li ziyi gave himself a topic called โ€four seasons change, eat while you eatโ€. after the suggestion of meipai editor, it became โ€ancient foodโ€ and it is still used today. 

in september 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for li ziyu to get more attention in the future. sina weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support. 

as mentioned at the beginning of the article, liu tongming brought her weibo resources support. 

one day in september 2016, li feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private weibo message from โ€mr. lโ€. mr. l expressed his love for li ziyuโ€s video content, felt that he had fulfilled his taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her. 

for a long time after that, li ziyi received mr. lโ€s private letter. โ€it would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. this is uschinaโ€s proud traditional culture should be seen by people in china and around the world. โ€mr. l said in a private message. 

at first, after seeing these private messages, li ziyi didnโ€t care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. until one day, mr. l came to the city where li zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. mr. lโ€s politeness and clear logical thinking made li slowly drop his initial alert. 

this accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of li zizhen. not long after the meal was over, with the help of mr. l, li zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on sina weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing li zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head. 

this experience is partly recorded in a diary of li zizheng that year. some insiders close to the senior executives of weinian technology confirmed to tencentโ€s โ€shenwangโ€ that the โ€mr. lโ€ is actually liu tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. daxiong liu, the founder of wei nian technology, an mcn company to which li zizhen now belongs. 

on december 8th, the reading volume of a weibo topic labeled โ€is li ziyi a cultural outputโ€ climbed to 800 million. li zizheng was once again on the hot search list. 

the video created by li ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now. 

extensive overseas communication is an important reason for li zihuanโ€s renewed attention. some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional chinese culture and cuisine. others think that her video is not completely true to reflect chinaโ€s rural life. 

even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a dj, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life itโ€s still just a fiction for character setting. 

an insider of weinian technology told tencentโ€s โ€deep webโ€ that li ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by li ziyi himself. the popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. in fact, both li zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs. 

until august 17, 2018, li ziyiโ€s eponymous tmall store officially opened. six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. a year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the li zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million. 
the value behind li ziyiโ€s ip is being quickly tapped. 

li ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. but now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements. 
according to tianyan search, โ€deep webโ€ shows that mcn hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd., which li ziyi belongs to, was established on february 28, 2013, with a registered capital of rmb 5.208 million. according to the introduction, wei nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates kol into ip through short videos and extends to consumer brands. 

the information of qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark โ€li zihuanโ€. the applicant companies are hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd. the product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, financial property management, catering and accommodation. 

not only that, wei nian also has inextricable links with li ziyuโ€s companies. 

according to the eye inspection, li jiajia (should be the original name of li ziyu) established sichuan ziyu culture communication co., ltd. on july 20, 2017, and wei nian is its shareholder, holding 51% of the shares. supervisor, li jiajia holds 49% of the shares. 

according to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd., including greenland holdings, zte, xinhua media, vanke, light media, etc. . 
among the shareholders of weinian technology, sina weibo is particularly eye-catching. 

from wei nian technology to sina weibo, li ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to. 
in her own words, she changed from โ€a little transparent to a person who is so useless to societyโ€. after entering the public view and being noticed by more people, li ziyiโ€s sense of responsibility has also become heavier. 
โ€i want to do what i can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non-heritage cultural craftsmen, and i want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. li ziyi said. 

source: https://www.ww01.net/en/archives/33757","如果您在这里是新手，那么这绝对是您需要了解的有关Liziqi（Li Ziyi）的一切：

1990年，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）跌倒在四川米扬（Mianyang）。她的父母很小的时候就离婚了。后来，她的父亲去世了，李齐伊成为孤儿。他的继母对她不好。李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）在微博上提到，当他的继母将头发拖入排水沟并被殴打时，他有半死的经历。

爷爷和奶奶使孙女感到沮丧，最后决定带李Ziyu回家。当李齐伊（Li Ziyi）五年级时，他的祖父再次去世，他的祖母很难抚养她继续上学。李齐（Li Ziyi）在14岁时不得不辍学，独自去城市努力工作，并开始了八年的流浪生活。她的第一人生非常艰难。她睡在公园椅上，挠头两个月。

Li Ziyi还曾在酒店担任服务生，每月薪水为300元。为了赚取更多的收入，她去学习演奏唱片并在酒吧里唱歌。后来，在谈论此事时，李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）坦率地说：“我不是说当时我喜欢音乐，只是为了生活，我觉得这是付出的。”

2012年，由于奶奶曾经生病，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）担心她后来会后悔，扔掉所有工作并返回奶奶。 “靠近，我感到更加放松。”

返回后，李Ziyi开了一家淘宝商店，但业务一直在运行，他几乎没有吃饭。 2015年，在他的弟弟的影响下，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）接触了短视频平台Meipai。直到2016年，看到他的弟弟在Meipai上有一些粉丝，并且拥有更多的粉丝可以改善淘宝业务的心态，Li Ziyi重新进入Meipai，为自己的视频节目做准备。

她之所以选择以这种风格拍摄视频与她的童年环境密切相关的原因。

李·齐（Li Ziyi）在接受西那俱乐部（Nina Club）的客厅采访时说：“所有这些在农村自给自足的事情，对我来说，它们嫉妒。在简短的视频中，她选择从最熟悉的地方开始。

一开始，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）称自己为“四个季节变化，吃饭时吃饭”。在Meipai编辑的建议之后，它变成了“古老的食物”，并且今天仍然使用。

2016年9月，一个新的机会悄悄地出现了，这也成为李Zyu将来更加关注的重要推动者。 Sina Weibo开始公开寻找更多出色的简短视频创建者以获得资源支持。

正如文章开头所述，刘·汤明（Liu Tongming）为她带来了微博的资源支持。

2016年9月的一天，古老的简短视频博客作者Li Feng意外收到了“先生先生的私人微博消息”。 L”。 L先生表达了对李Ziyu的视频内容的热爱，觉得他已经实现了他的作陶王的梦，并希望与她见面。

此后很长一段时间，Li Ziyi收到了L先生的私人信。 “这样一个好视频让这个人看到它是可惜的。这是中国和世界各地的人们应该看到USCHINA骄傲的传统文化。 “先生。我在一条私人消息中说。

起初，在看到这些私人消息后，李Ziyi并不在乎太多，甚至不必担心遇到骗子。直到一天，L先生来到了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）所在的城市，并想请她吃饭和聊天。 L先生的礼貌和清晰的逻辑思维使李慢慢地放弃了最初的警报。

这次偶然的会议彻底改变了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）的生活轨迹。用餐结束后不久，在L先生的帮助下，李·Zizheng（Li Zizheng）得到了Sina Weibo的大量资源的支持，加快了她的知名度，并允许Li Zizhen赶到头部网络影响者的排队。

这种经历部分记录在那年的李Zizheng日记中。一些与温尼安技术高级管理人员接近的内部人士证实了腾讯的“申旺”，即“先生先生L”实际上是刘·汤明（Liu Tongming），他的化名是公开报道的。 Wei Nian Technology的创始人Daxiong Liu是Li Zizhen现在属于的MCN公司。

12月8日，一个标有“是文化产出”的微博主题的阅读量攀升至8亿。李Zizheng再次在热门搜索列表中。

Li Ziyi和她创建的视频现在已成为一个值得研究的现象。

广泛的海外沟通是李齐伊安（Li Zihuan）重新关注的重要原因。有人说她已经拍摄了理想的乡村生活，并传播了中国传统文化和美食的魅力。其他人则认为她的视频并非完全正确地反映中国的乡村生活。

自从爆炸再次提出以来一直很受欢迎的疑问，例如成为DJ，成为富人的第二代，无论是我自己的视频，是否有强烈的推动力，视频是真的对于农村生活，这仍然是角色环境的小说。

Weinian Technology的一位内部人士告诉Tencent的“ Deep Web”，Li Ziyi是普通的，相关的视频内容是由Li Ziyi本人制作的。受欢迎程度不是公司和他本人的倡议。实际上，他背后的李·齐伊安（Li Zihuan）和微读团队都非常低调，他们非常热情，拒绝了当前的所有采访需求。

直到2018年8月17日，Li Ziyi的同名TMALL商店正式开业。上网六天后，当时只有五种产品的商店的销售额超过150,000，销售额超过1000万。一年后，李Zizhen旗舰店展示的21种产品的总销售额超过130万，总销售额达到7100万。
Li Ziyi的IP背后的价值正在迅速挖掘。

Li Ziyi从头开始，并以自己的力量获得了第一批粉丝。但是现在，声名和财富的受欢迎程度和收益显然不再只是她的成就。
根据Tianyan Search的说法，“ Deep Web”表明，Li Ziyi属于的McN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。于2013年2月28日成立，其注册资本为5.208亿元。根据引言，Wei Nian是一家娱乐娱乐公司，通过简短的视频将KOL孵化为IP，并扩展到消费者品牌。

Qixinbao的信息表明，商标“ Li Zihuan”有100多种知识产权信息。申请人公司是Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。产品类别包括食品，服装，鞋子和帽子，染料和脂肪，染料和脂肪，啤酒和饮料，金融物业管理，餐饮和住宿。

不仅如此，Wei Nian还与Li Ziyu的公司建立了不可忽视的联系。

根据眼睛检查，李亚吉亚（应该是李祖的原始名称）于2017年7月20日成立了四川Ziyu文化传播公司有限公司。主管Li Jiajia持有49％的股份。

根据其他数据，Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。的背后有多达50家受益公司，包括Greenland Holdings，ZTE，新华社媒体，Vanke，Light Media等。
在Weinian技术的股东中，Sina Weibo特别引人注目。

从Wei Nian Technology到Sina Weibo，Li Ziyi逐渐拥有互联网名人期待的最佳卡片。
用她自己的话说，她从“有点透明变成了一个对社会无用的人”。在进入公众观点并被更多人注意到之后，李齐的责任感也变得更加重。
“我想尽我所能，做更多对社会有益的事情，例如传统文化，非遗产文化工匠的传播，我想向所有人展示这些旧事物，以便更多的人知道。李Ziyi说。

second, many fake news of rumoring and discredited chinese demons outside the wall flies. some people who are not mature are not enough to distinguish. it is easy to be misleading. it is the same as the brainwashing sun flowers in taiwan. the united states. the country is very good at using tools such as the internet and traditional media to combine the right to speak and subvert other countries in combination with the right to speak in the hand. the spring of arabia, which occurred in a series of countries in a series of countries in the middle east, is the united states and other use of the internet hegemony to incite and subvert other countries. the big ""masterpiece"", the current violent turmoil that occurs in hong kong is the same. as long as those who have a little mind and a little international insight can see clearly. assuming that the middle east countries also had comprehensive internet protection measures at that time, they would not be by the united states. using social media such as the internet to easily incite their domestic fighting and turmoil, it ultimately leads to the tragic situation of war, the people's non -talk, refugee flowing, and economic collapse. the history of traditional colonial countries such as the united states and britain used the internet to infiltrate and subvert the country in one day or two. the intelligence department uses the internet and other tools to conduct as many as 39 countries that have infiltrated and subverted other countries. this is what the united states is said in hillary's mouth. china's firewall to a certain extent has a certain blocking effect on this intelligence agency using the internet to incite public opinion and cause social turmoil to ultimately achieve the ""ingenious strength"" of subverting the country's regime. the entire exposure of the eyelids of the anti -chinese countries will be manipulated by the information departments such as the united states, which leads to the chaos in hong kong today. the purpose of trump is to use hong kong as a bargaining chip to the extreme of china to pressure china. in order to eventually occupy more cheap china in the trade war negotiations.
third, in fact, for the consideration of national security, many countries have walls, south korea, and germany, usa, and germany. india envy china to have bat, and it is ready to engage in the wall. after all foreigners, snowden exposed the prism door, especially after the german chancellor merkel's mobile phone was listened to the cia, germany was also building a wall. it seems that this is a trend. the internet has now become a new battlefield. the major countries are developing network troops and building walls crazy, but the forms are different. the united states has long been set off the world in the world. in addition to prism doors, there are also five -eye alliances. the internet world has long been reduced to the colonies in the united states without knowing it. the ability to be capable of capable of has a wall. only those who are unable to build it are going. the american wall is much more advanced than the chinese wall technology. it is difficult to find that this is really a bit embarrassing. in fact, the background is also recording cross -border traffic and even secretly analyzing the content of the mail package. similar words such as ""production"" and ""buying suicide bombs"", and soon, fbi agents came to your house to search. these are keywords and sensitive words monitoring techniques. obviously haha, the chinese wall is a pediatric department compared to the american wall. chinese technology can only monitor itself, and even the technology can not completely make it unable to turn the wall. however, lao and american technology can monitor the world. the gap is really not a little or two, but a generation and two generations.
some people say that china is engaged in net walls to be afraid that domestic people will know what the so -called truth, and the actual situation is exactly the opposite. if you are really afraid of people in the country to know what the so -called ""truth"" and why do you put so more than 100 million domestic in china a year people go out to see ""truth""? can you stop it? are you afraid that more than 100 million people will go out to see the ""truth""? obviously this is conflict. china has more than 150 million people every year, and 130 million foreigners entering china have become the world's largest in the world. one of the tourist destinations, as many as 10 million foreigners living in china, as many as 60 million chinese people living abroad, hundreds of foreign embassies and consulates in china, more than 100,000 foreign media resident reporters, there are more than 10 million international multinational companies and foreign trade companies are held in hundreds of international conferences and large -scale activities in china each year. after 40 years of opening up, china has already been integrated into the world in all aspects. in the era of information such in information, everyone can spread through the global era when everyone picks up a mobile phone, saying that the idea of โ€โ€being afraid of people know what ""truth"" is really naive, and it also proves how ridiculous the guessing people who want to eat melon for granted. essence
the fourth is to protect the growth and growth of its own internet industry. do not want to be occupied by american companies like the same domestic internet as the world. the top ten important network industries in the world are either the united states or in mainland china, and they have begun to enter the global market. the top ten internet companies in the world, each of which each country and the united states are half. other countries are zero. some people once said that there are only two world internet countries. the united states and china (this is permanently set in wuzhen, zhejiang, zhejiang, china. to. mainland china โ€s internet strength is second in the world. although the overall strength is still far behind the united states, it is the only country that is comparable to the united states in the internet field. the european union, india, russia, canada, japan, australia cannot do it, because of the degree of pain, the market, the market, the population, the population, the funds, the language, the policy, the technology, culture, etc. when we laughed at this firewall, we did not know that only from politics, the vision of thinking was so narrow, and the sour people's vision was like a rat, foolish. the internet achievement of the walls of the wall in china is: we have created a set of our own network industry chain, the second largest in the world. and when netizens all over the world brush fb and yt every day, when google's hou, they did not realize that their countries, including some european countries, have become ""colonies"" in the united states of the united states, not only the online market and public opinion were facebook, but they were facebook. foreign network power control dominates other foreign network power control, and the people of their domestic companies must also pay expensive advertising fees and usage fees. and all the personal data of their national and enterprises, all of which are stored in the server of the us internet company giants, have long been safe. in the past two years, fackbook has repeatedly gone out the incidents of leakage of their personal information information and selling. it is one of the proof.
the fifth is to facilitate the management of the network and crack down on cyber crimes. the internet is the same as a real society. every day, a lot of criminal activities are filled with criminal activities. some of them have subverted the country, illegal operations, and criminal criminals, such as online fraud, money laundering, online gambling, mlm, cult transmission ... and police officers in a country it can only be enforced in its own country because of the multinational nature of the internet. if criminals set up the server abroad, and criminal activities such as fraud on ordinary people in the country, the police can only watch them implement criminal crimes against domestic abroad. there is no way to manage it. this is not a good thing for the interests of ordinary people. this wall can filter most of this kind of overseas fraud, gambling, money laundering, etc. most filtering can increase the difficulty of crime of overseas criminal criminals, which is valuable. ordinary people do nโ€t care about turning over the wall, and they do nโ€t touch the law. for example, college students write papers to check foreign language information, etc., and 99%of chinese resources are on the internet in the country. the chinese content outside the wall is added. there are more than 1%. compared to those who do not understand foreign languages, the wall is the real sea. it is just a small puddle on the wall. i am not proficient in foreign languages. individuals are proficient in a foreign language, so there is no great impact on the wall. besides, this firewall does not block all foreign websites outside, but just block part of the content of the country and the people. many foreign websites can be accessed directly. domestic ipv6 users, and some campus networks. education network can directly access foreign websites. many domestic websites, including apps, can also be accessed directly from abroad, such as weibo, douyin, and douyin, douyin, douyin, and douyin, douyin, and douyin, douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin, and douyin. douban ... you can access it directly from abroad, and the firewall is not intercepted by a knife. there are so many embassies, multinational companies, foreign trade companies, foreign -related institutions, universities, and research institutions. this number is an astronomical figure. so many people are legally used to use external networks for daily work and business. even the official cctv in china is on yt. with the official channel, it can be seen that the role of the firewall is not to block the network and outside the network. the function is obviously filtering, filtering out those things that are harmful to national security and the interests of the people, and retaining beneficial things. a person is sick alone. everyone knows to go to the hospital to see a doctor. when you take medicine and take medicine, you have to remove the germs that endanger your body to keep your body healthy. why can't the internet be filtered out of those bad things and keep the internet be healthy. in short, weighing the advantages and disadvantages and comprehensive considerations, li yuan is more than disadvantaged.
the above just means that i am not ""refuted for refutation."" everyoneโ€s iq, eq, experience, observation, and international vision are different. the depth and breadth of thinking are different, but one thing must be remembered. that is, don't float in the appearance, don't want to be cloudy, but get rid of prejudice and settings, think independently, and approach the essence and truth. in this way, you can truly achieve ""not confused"" without being stupid. break and use.","@paulchen1067 不知道是你的理解力问题还是看得不仔细，我说的是“实际上保护了台湾网民，对台湾有利”，不是说“为了保护台湾”。研发防火墙，主观上虽然不是为了保护台湾，但客观上保护了台湾，既“实际上”保护了台湾。 至于研发防火墙的原因，国内很多论坛上都有讨论，主要归纳为几点： 
一是因为墙外很多黄色成人网站，这些色情网站没有任何防护，小朋友都可以随意点开，这些总不能让那些还在念书的小学生初中生等小朋友看到才对吧，反正我是不希望我家的两个小朋友在不该看到这些东西的年龄看到这些色情成人网站的，所以它至少保护了我家的小孩，我是很感激的； 
第二，墙外很多造谣抹黑妖魔化中国的假新闻满天飞，有些年纪不大还不成熟的人思考力分辨力还不够，很容易被误导就跟台湾那些被洗脑的太阳花觉青一样，美国等国家非常擅长利用互联网和传统媒体等工具结合手中控制的舆论话语权对他国进行意识形态的渗透和颠覆，发生在中东一系列国家的阿拉伯之春就是美国等利用互联网霸权煽动颠覆它国的一大“杰作”，目前发生在香港的暴力动乱也是如此，只要稍微有点脑子有点国际洞察力的人都看得一清二楚，假设当时中东国家也拥有完善的互联网保护措施，也就不会被美国等利用互联网等社交媒体轻易就煽动其国内的内斗和动乱，最终导致如今这些国家战火纷飞、民不聊生、难民流离、经济崩溃的惨状。美英等传统殖民国家利用互联网对它国进行渗透颠覆的历史可不是一天两天了，从乌克兰到摩洛哥，从利比亚到叙利亚，从埃及再到委内瑞拉，据维基解密统计，冷战结束后，美国CIA等情报部门利用互联网等工具对它国进行渗透颠覆搞掉的国家多达39个，这就是希拉里口中所说的美国的“巧实力""吧，毕竟美国掌握着全球互联网霸权和舆论话语权，而中国的防火墙在一定程度上对这种情报机关利用网络进行舆论煽动和造成社会动荡最终达到颠覆别国政权的“巧实力”有一定的阻挡作用，而香港正是因为互联网过于开放，毫不设防，整个暴露在反中国家的眼皮底下，才会被美国等情报部门随意操弄，导致今日香港乱局，而特朗普的目的正是要将香港搞乱作为向中国极限施压的一个筹码，以便于最终在贸易战谈判中占到中国更多便宜。 
第三，实际上出于国家安全的考虑，很多国家都有墻，韩国有，美国俄国德国都有，印度羡慕中国有BAT，也准备要搞墙了，泰国防部建立“天网” 追踪境内全部外国人，斯诺登曝光棱镜门后，尤其是德国总理默克尔的手机被美国中情局监听后，德国也在筑墙，看来这是趋势，网路现在已经成了一个全新的战场，各大国都在发展网络部队，疯狂筑墙，只是形式不一样而已，而美国，早就在全世界布下了天罗地网，除了棱镜门，还有五眼联盟，监视全世界，完全没设防的国家，网络世界早就沦为了美国的殖民地而不自知，有能力的国家基本都有墻，没能力建设的就只有随它去了，而美国的墻比中国的墻技术先进多了，一般人都很难发现，这个确实有点屌，其实后台一样在记录跨境流量甚至暗中抓取邮件包内容自动分析，发邮件人一点感觉都没有，在美国境内上网发表“刺杀特朗普”""轰炸白宫""或“制作”“购买自杀式炸弹”等类似字眼，很快就有FBI的探员来你家敲门搜查了，这些都是关键词、敏感词的监听技术，不像中国的墙简单粗暴，太明显了哈哈，中国墻跟美国墻相比就是小儿科，中国的技术只能监控自己，甚至技术还达不到完全让网民无法翻墙哈，但老美的技术却能监控全世界，中美的技术水平差距真的不是一点两点，而是一代两代。 
有人说中国搞网墙是为了怕国内的人知道什么所谓的真相，实际情况正好相反，如果真是怕国内的人知道什么所谓的“真相”，那干嘛每年还放那么多一亿多国内的人出去看“真相""？挡得住么？不怕这一亿多人出去看到“真相”么，显然这是自相矛盾的，中国每年出国人数一亿五千多万人次，入境中国的外国人1.2亿人次，中国已成为全球最大的旅游目的国之一，在中国生活的外国人高达一千多万，居住在国外的华人高达六千多万，中国常驻有数百个外国使领馆，十多万国外媒体常驻记者，有一千多万家国际跨国公司和外贸公司，每年在中国有数百场国际会议和大型活动召开，历经40年的开放，中国早已全方位深度融入了全球，每年这么多与世界的联系与互动，在资讯这么发达，人人拿起手机随手一拍就能传遍全球的时代，说怕人知道什么“真相”的想法真的极其幼稚，也证明国内那些想当然的吃瓜群众的猜测显得多么荒谬。 
第四，是为了保护国内自己的互联网產业的成长壮大，不希望跟全世界一样国内的互联网全被美国公司佔领。全世界排名前十的重要网络产业，不是美国的就是中国大陆的，而且开始进军全球市场。全球十大互联网公司，中美各占一半，其它国家为零，有人曾言，世界互联网大国只有两个，美国和中国（这点从世界互联网大会会址永久定在中国浙江乌镇就不难看出）。中国大陆互联网实力全球第二，虽然整体实力仍远远落后于美国，却是唯一在互联网领域有机会媲美美国的国家。欧盟，印度，俄罗斯，加拿大，日本，澳大利亚都做不到，因为痛合度，市场，幅员，人口，资金，语言，政策，技术，文化，等等各种因素。当我们在嘲笑这个防火墙的时候，殊不知，只从政治看问题，眼界思维如此之狭隘，酸民眼光如鼠、愚不可及。在中国这设墙的二十多年的互联网成果是：我们打造了一套属于自己的网络产业链，全球第二大。而当全世界的网民每天在刷着FB、YT，谷歌的时侯，他们完全没有意识到自己国家包括一些欧洲国家已经沦为网络经济强国美国的“殖民地”，不仅网络市场和舆论被Facebook、Yahoo、Google等外来网络强权控制主导，其本国企业要接触自己的民众还必须支付昂贵的广告费和使用费等等费用。而把自己国家国民和企业的个人资料，隐私等全部储存在美国互联网公司巨头的服务器里，早已毫无安全可言，过去两年Fackbook公司多次暴出将其用户个人信息资料泄漏出卖的事件便是明证之一。 
第五，是为了便于网络的管理，打击网络犯罪。网络和现实社会一样，每天充斥着大量的犯罪活动，有颠覆国家的，非法营运的，还有刑事犯罪的，比如网络诈骗，洗钱，网络赌博，传销，邪教传播这些……而一个国家的警察只能在其本国境内执法，因为网络的跨国性，如果刑事犯罪分子把服务器架设在国外，而对国内的普通民众进行诈骗等犯罪活动，警察只能眼睁睁看着他们在境外实施对国内的犯罪，却没办法管得到，这对普通百姓的利益绝非好事，而这堵墙能过滤掉大部分这种境外诈骗、赌博、洗钱等针对国内民众的犯罪，虽然不能完全百分百过滤，但过滤大部分，能增加境外跨境刑事犯罪分子的犯罪难度，已经难能可贵了。普通人没事翻翻墙不会管，而且也不触法，比如 大学生写论文翻墙查外文资料等，而99%的中文资源都在境内的互联网上，墻外的中文內容加起來也沒有墻內的1%多，相對于不懂外语的人來說，墻內才是真正的大海，墻上只是一個小水坑而已，不熟练掌握外语，你翻出來也是來到了一片沙漠，因为并不是每个人都精通一门外语的，所以翻不了墙并没有什么太大的影响，况且这个防火墙并不是把所有外国网站全部挡在外面，而只是把一部分的对国家和百姓利益有害的内容拦在外面，国外很多网站是可以直接访问的，国内IPV6用户，还有一些校园网，教育网都是可以直接访问国外网站的，国内很多网站包括APP也可以从国外直接访问，比如微博、抖音、豆瓣......等都可以从国外直接访问，防火墙并没有一刀切地拦截。国内那么多大使馆、跨国公司、外贸公司，涉外机构、高校、研究机构，这数字是个天文数字，这么多人都在合法地使用外网进行日常工作和业务，连国内官方的央视都在YT上开了官方频道，可见防火墙的作用并不是要阻断网内和网外，其功能显然在于过滤，过滤掉了那些对国家安全和百姓利益有害的东西，保留了有益的东西，一个人生病了都知道去医院看医生，打针吃药甚至做手术都要除掉危害身体的病菌让身体保持健康，为什么互联网就不能过滤掉那些坏的东西让网络保持良性健康呢。 总之，权衡利弊，综合考虑的话，利远大于弊。 
以上，只是说明我并不是“为反驳而反驳”，每个人的智商、情商、阅历、观察力、国际视野都不一样，思维的深度、广度也不一样，但有一点是必须记住的，即不要浮于表象，不要人云亦云，而是摆脱成见和定势，独立思考，接近本质与真相，这样，才能真正达到“不惑”，且不会被愚蠢的自以为是绑架，更不会被他人的言辞蛊惑和利用。"

李从2015年开始在Meipai上发布她的视频。截至2020年，她在YouTube上拥有超过900万订阅者，在Sina Weibo上有超过2200万关注者，在Facebook上有超过300万关注者，并激发了许多博客作者发布类似内容。

她在2019年9月获得了《人民日报》的《人民选择奖》。CCTV称赞她，并表示：“李没有一个单词来宣传中国文化，并讲述了一个好的中国故事”。

我出生于斯里兰卡，五年前我移民到澳大利亚。经过非常挑战的岁月，我可以上个月在美丽的阳光海岸购买我的第一个房屋。现在，我可以从家里看到一个新的CDB，并且空间非常有限。但是，我真的很想成为极简主义者并拥有可持续的生活。

当我试图找到可持续花园的视频时，我遇到了李的视频。非常感谢您，李的灵感❤❤❤❤❤❤

在过去的几天里，我研究了她的许多视频。我可以从她那里学到很多东西。即使最近几个月我在频道上并不活跃，我还是会使用我的斯里兰卡文化背景和我的乌尔本，但可持续的生活来制作新的风格视频。我将制作一些有关Urben园艺，传统的斯里兰卡烹饪的视频，我将分享我为自己的第一个家节省的方式。目前，我的大多数英文视频

❤如果你们有任何改善我的频道的想法，请告诉我。
