in fact, the biggest reason for ziyi to sue the original company was that the original company secretly registered the trademark of ""li ziyi"", which means that if zi yi sat and ignored, the ownership of the ""li ziyi"" related trademarks will not be owned by her, so back to the company, how do you do this? li ziyi, this ip was before the cooperation with ""weisun"", and the behavior of ""micro -minded"" was too moral.

and the most profitable is the peripheral foods launched by the ""li ziyi"" trademark, such as ""snail powder"" and ""moon cakes"". ""the cooperation model is"" ziyi is responsible for video content creation, and the promotion of social media is subtle "", that is, so many years of ziyi only have only rely on the works taken by himself to obtain the income, but wei nian really relies on the signboard of"" li ziyi "" when the most beautiful scenery, a snail powder can sell for more than 2 billion years. ziyi can't get money, and even the three words ""li ziyi"" will be taken away. in the event that the brand ip of ""li ziyi"" is messed up, the most affected is ziyi himself. because the capital can be found to find other people. but such a good image ip cannot fall into the hands of ""capital"".

fortunately, ziyi regained all the relevant trademark ownership of ""li ziyi"", and the ratio of ziyi in the ""sichuan ziyi cultural company"" also had the previous 49 %, which became 99 %. basically, zi zi has been fighting the ownership of his ""name"" in the past two years.

it turns out that capital can really be so terrible. utilizing people √ business does not understand the law, it can be ""legal"" to swallow her ""intellectual property rights"" in disguise.","@SAiS55 这个不好说，因为收入分配的问题我们也不清楚。但是子柒曾在微博上说过，所有社交平台的账号都是归子柒所有。

其实，子柒告原公司最大的原因就是，原公司偷偷把“李子柒”注册商标，也就是说如果子柒坐而不管，以后“李子柒”相关的商标所有权就不归她所拥有，是归公司的，这怎么行呢？李子柒这个ip是子柒在和“微念”合作之前就有的，“微念”的行为太不道德了。

并且最赚钱的是“微念”利用“李子柒”商标推出的周边食品，像“螺蛳粉”“月饼”等等，“子柒”几乎分不到什么钱，“子柒”和“微念”的合作模式是“子柒负责视频内容创作，微妙负责社交媒体的推广”，也就是说这么多年子柒只有靠自己拍摄的作品来获取收益，然而微念确靠着“李子柒”这个招牌，最风光的时候单单一个螺蛳粉就能卖出20多亿一年的销售额。子柒分不到钱也就罢了，连“李子柒”这三个字也要被夺走，万一以后微念搞砸了“李子柒”这个品牌ip，最受影响的是子柒本人，因为资本吸完血可以找其他人。但是“李子柒”这么好的形象ip是不能落入“资本”的手里。

很庆幸，子柒夺回了“李子柒”所有相关的商标所有权，并且子柒在“四川子柒文化公司”中的股权比例也有之前的49％，变为99％，微念只持有1％，基本上子柒过去2年都是在争夺自己“名字”的所有权。

原来资本真的可以这么可怕，利用人们√商业对法律的不了解，可以“合法”的变相侵吞她人的“知识产权”简直是让人后备发凉"

5981,UgxvAuJTFlMG5TuJm3F4AaABAg,0,2 years ago,"if you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about liziqi ( li ziyi ): 

in 1990, li ziyi fell to the ground in mianyang, sichuan. her parents divorced when she was very young. later, her father died, and li ziyi became an orphan. his stepmother didnโ€t treat her well. li zizhen mentioned on weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten. 

grandpa and grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take li ziyu home and live. when li ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. at the age of 14, li ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. her first life was very hard. she slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months. 

li ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. in order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. later, when talking about the matter, li zizhen frankly said: โ€i didnโ€t say that i liked music at that time, just to live, i felt that it was well paid.โ€ 

in 2012, because grandma was ill once, li ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. โ€being closer, i feel more at ease.โ€ 

after returning, li ziyi opened a taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. in 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, li ziyi was exposed to the short video platform meipai. until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of taobao business, li ziyi re-entered meipai to prepare for his own video program. 

the reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment. 

in an interview with the living room of sina club, li ziyi mentioned, โ€all these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. in the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places. 

in the beginning, li ziyi gave himself a topic called โ€four seasons change, eat while you eatโ€. after the suggestion of meipai editor, it became โ€ancient foodโ€ and it is still used today. 

in september 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for li ziyu to get more attention in the future. sina weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support. 

as mentioned at the beginning of the article, liu tongming brought her weibo resources support. 

one day in september 2016, li feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private weibo message from โ€mr. lโ€. mr. l expressed his love for li ziyuโ€s video content, felt that he had fulfilled his taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her. 

for a long time after that, li ziyi received mr. lโ€s private letter. โ€it would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. this is uschinaโ€s proud traditional culture should be seen by people in china and around the world. โ€mr. l said in a private message. 

at first, after seeing these private messages, li ziyi didnโ€t care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. until one day, mr. l came to the city where li zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. mr. lโ€s politeness and clear logical thinking made li slowly drop his initial alert. 

this accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of li zizhen. not long after the meal was over, with the help of mr. l, li zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on sina weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing li zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head. 

this experience is partly recorded in a diary of li zizheng that year. some insiders close to the senior executives of weinian technology confirmed to tencentโ€s โ€shenwangโ€ that the โ€mr. lโ€ is actually liu tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. daxiong liu, the founder of wei nian technology, an mcn company to which li zizhen now belongs. 

on december 8th, the reading volume of a weibo topic labeled โ€is li ziyi a cultural outputโ€ climbed to 800 million. li zizheng was once again on the hot search list. 

the video created by li ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now. 

extensive overseas communication is an important reason for li zihuanโ€s renewed attention. some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional chinese culture and cuisine. others think that her video is not completely true to reflect chinaโ€s rural life. 

even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a dj, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life itโ€s still just a fiction for character setting. 

an insider of weinian technology told tencentโ€s โ€deep webโ€ that li ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by li ziyi himself. the popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. in fact, both li zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs. 

until august 17, 2018, li ziyiโ€s eponymous tmall store officially opened. six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. a year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the li zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million. 
the value behind li ziyiโ€s ip is being quickly tapped. 

li ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. but now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements. 
according to tianyan search, โ€deep webโ€ shows that mcn hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd., which li ziyi belongs to, was established on february 28, 2013, with a registered capital of rmb 5.208 million. according to the introduction, wei nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates kol into ip through short videos and extends to consumer brands. 

the information of qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark โ€li zihuanโ€. the applicant companies are hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd. the product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, financial property management, catering and accommodation. 

not only that, wei nian also has inextricable links with li ziyuโ€s companies. 

according to the eye inspection, li jiajia (should be the original name of li ziyu) established sichuan ziyu culture communication co., ltd. on july 20, 2017, and wei nian is its shareholder, holding 51% of the shares. supervisor, li jiajia holds 49% of the shares. 

according to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind hangzhou weinian technology co., ltd., including greenland holdings, zte, xinhua media, vanke, light media, etc. . 
among the shareholders of weinian technology, sina weibo is particularly eye-catching. 

from wei nian technology to sina weibo, li ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to. 
in her own words, she changed from โ€a little transparent to a person who is so useless to societyโ€. after entering the public view and being noticed by more people, li ziyiโ€s sense of responsibility has also become heavier. 
โ€i want to do what i can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non-heritage cultural craftsmen, and i want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. li ziyi said. 

source: https://www.ww01.net/en/archives/33757","如果您在这里是新手，那么这绝对是您需要了解的有关Liziqi（Li Ziyi）的一切：

1990年，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）跌倒在四川米扬（Mianyang）。她的父母很小的时候就离婚了。后来，她的父亲去世了，李齐伊成为孤儿。他的继母对她不好。李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）在微博上提到，当他的继母将头发拖入排水沟并被殴打时，他有半死的经历。

爷爷和奶奶使孙女感到沮丧，最后决定带李Ziyu回家。当李齐伊（Li Ziyi）五年级时，他的祖父再次去世，他的祖母很难抚养她继续上学。李齐（Li Ziyi）在14岁时不得不辍学，独自去城市努力工作，并开始了八年的流浪生活。她的第一人生非常艰难。她睡在公园椅上，挠头两个月。

Li Ziyi还曾在酒店担任服务生，每月薪水为300元。为了赚取更多的收入，她去学习演奏唱片并在酒吧里唱歌。后来，在谈论此事时，李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）坦率地说：“我不是说当时我喜欢音乐，只是为了生活，我觉得这是付出的。”

2012年，由于奶奶曾经生病，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）担心她后来会后悔，扔掉所有工作并返回奶奶。 “靠近，我感到更加放松。”

返回后，李Ziyi开了一家淘宝商店，但业务一直在运行，他几乎没有吃饭。 2015年，在他的弟弟的影响下，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）接触了短视频平台Meipai。直到2016年，看到他的弟弟在Meipai上有一些粉丝，并且拥有更多的粉丝可以改善淘宝业务的心态，Li Ziyi重新进入Meipai，为自己的视频节目做准备。

她之所以选择以这种风格拍摄视频与她的童年环境密切相关的原因。

李·齐（Li Ziyi）在接受西那俱乐部（Nina Club）的客厅采访时说：“所有这些在农村自给自足的事情，对我来说，它们嫉妒。在简短的视频中，她选择从最熟悉的地方开始。

一开始，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）称自己为“四个季节变化，吃饭时吃饭”。在Meipai编辑的建议之后，它变成了“古老的食物”，并且今天仍然使用。

2016年9月，一个新的机会悄悄地出现了，这也成为李Zyu将来更加关注的重要推动者。 Sina Weibo开始公开寻找更多出色的简短视频创建者以获得资源支持。

正如文章开头所述，刘·汤明（Liu Tongming）为她带来了微博的资源支持。

2016年9月的一天，古老的简短视频博客作者Li Feng意外收到了“先生先生的私人微博消息”。 L”。 L先生表达了对李Ziyu的视频内容的热爱，觉得他已经实现了他的作陶王的梦，并希望与她见面。

此后很长一段时间，Li Ziyi收到了L先生的私人信。 “这样一个好视频让这个人看到它是可惜的。这是中国和世界各地的人们应该看到USCHINA骄傲的传统文化。 “先生。我在一条私人消息中说。

起初，在看到这些私人消息后，李Ziyi并不在乎太多，甚至不必担心遇到骗子。直到一天，L先生来到了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）所在的城市，并想请她吃饭和聊天。 L先生的礼貌和清晰的逻辑思维使李慢慢地放弃了最初的警报。

这次偶然的会议彻底改变了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）的生活轨迹。用餐结束后不久，在L先生的帮助下，李·Zizheng（Li Zizheng）得到了Sina Weibo的大量资源的支持，加快了她的知名度，并允许Li Zizhen赶到头部网络影响者的排队。

这种经历部分记录在那年的李Zizheng日记中。一些与温尼安技术高级管理人员接近的内部人士证实了腾讯的“申旺”，即“先生先生L”实际上是刘·汤明（Liu Tongming），他的化名是公开报道的。 Wei Nian Technology的创始人Daxiong Liu是Li Zizhen现在属于的MCN公司。

12月8日，一个标有“是文化产出”的微博主题的阅读量攀升至8亿。李Zizheng再次在热门搜索列表中。

Li Ziyi和她创建的视频现在已成为一个值得研究的现象。

广泛的海外沟通是李齐伊安（Li Zihuan）重新关注的重要原因。有人说她已经拍摄了理想的乡村生活，并传播了中国传统文化和美食的魅力。其他人则认为她的视频并非完全正确地反映中国的乡村生活。

自从爆炸再次提出以来一直很受欢迎的疑问，例如成为DJ，成为富人的第二代，无论是我自己的视频，是否有强烈的推动力，视频是真的对于农村生活，这仍然是角色环境的小说。

Weinian Technology的一位内部人士告诉Tencent的“ Deep Web”，Li Ziyi是普通的，相关的视频内容是由Li Ziyi本人制作的。受欢迎程度不是公司和他本人的倡议。实际上，他背后的李·齐伊安（Li Zihuan）和微读团队都非常低调，他们非常热情，拒绝了当前的所有采访需求。

直到2018年8月17日，Li Ziyi的同名TMALL商店正式开业。上网六天后，当时只有五种产品的商店的销售额超过150,000，销售额超过1000万。一年后，李Zizhen旗舰店展示的21种产品的总销售额超过130万，总销售额达到7100万。
Li Ziyi的IP背后的价值正在迅速挖掘。

Li Ziyi从头开始，并以自己的力量获得了第一批粉丝。但是现在，声名和财富的受欢迎程度和收益显然不再只是她的成就。
根据Tianyan Search的说法，“ Deep Web”表明，Li Ziyi属于的McN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。于2013年2月28日成立，其注册资本为5.208亿元。根据引言，Wei Nian是一家娱乐娱乐公司，通过简短的视频将KOL孵化为IP，并扩展到消费者品牌。

Qixinbao的信息表明，商标“ Li Zihuan”有100多种知识产权信息。申请人公司是Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。产品类别包括食品，服装，鞋子和帽子，染料和脂肪，染料和脂肪，啤酒和饮料，金融物业管理，餐饮和住宿。

不仅如此，Wei Nian还与Li Ziyu的公司建立了不可忽视的联系。

根据眼睛检查，李亚吉亚（应该是李祖的原始名称）于2017年7月20日成立了四川Ziyu文化传播公司有限公司。主管Li Jiajia持有49％的股份。

根据其他数据，Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。的背后有多达50家受益公司，包括Greenland Holdings，ZTE，新华社媒体，Vanke，Light Media等。
在Weinian技术的股东中，Sina Weibo特别引人注目。

从Wei Nian Technology到Sina Weibo，Li Ziyi逐渐拥有互联网名人期待的最佳卡片。
用她自己的话说，她从“有点透明变成了一个对社会无用的人”。在进入公众观点并被更多人注意到之后，李齐的责任感也变得更加重。
“我想尽我所能，做更多对社会有益的事情，例如传统文化，非遗产文化工匠的传播，我想向所有人展示这些旧事物，以便更多的人知道。李Ziyi说。

maybe where liziqi lives in sichuan there’s is more natural beauty but there is lots of dirt and construction and decrepit stuff she probably doesn’t show on camera.
