(ive also shown these videos to my dad and he also loves them, my entire family is full of cooks so this was a breath of fresh air)",我妈妈每天都会每天煮正宗的菲律宾食物，而大约一年前，她失去了与癌症的斗争后，我从来没有像从学校回家回家的感觉，闻到了有史以来最令人惊叹的食物。您的视频带回了这些记忆，食物的煎炸在您的视频中听起来一样，她在锅中扔食物，锅上的金属刮擦，我什至可以闻到屏幕上发生的事情。您的视频使我免于忘记她，您的视频在那些黑暗的时期帮助了我，尽管它不是菲律宾的食物，但您的烹饪方式与我妈妈的烹饪方式如此相似。谢谢你。 （我还向我的父亲展示了这些视频，他也爱他们，我的整个家庭都充满了厨师，所以这是新鲜空气的呼吸）
3065,UgxK7tTx9vC9pt59mmJ4AaABAg,634,1 year ago (edited),"as we can see in the videos, the background of the forest, farms, yards, cooking stoves and utensils are real. in the past especially for the chinese people our ancestors work hard on every inch of lands they have. they make use of everything that nature provides to them. generation by generations the land grew flourish. this final generation from baby boomers era (like the grandma) likely the last of their kind, because due to the changes of modern and tech/gadjets world. not many still living up the life just like showed in the video because the generation x,y and z are working and living in cities to find income and mostly leaving the old man/woman at their village. in the end leaving the lands and farms unattended (because grandpa/grandma are already old to work and care the lands).
most end up selling their land and the money the new generation get were invested in businesses, building or renovating house in the cities or in another country, etc. 
as you saw in the video, you can see herbs, clean ponds and rivers, varieties of vegetations, animals like birds, chicken, duck, are well taken care of. these are their daily source of food because there are no supermarket nearby where you can buy from there. thus, why need to buy if you can get it fresh from your own farm? chinese are particular in what they eat (diets and healthy) so they grew herbs, vegetables and live stocks. that is how the baby boomers generation survived along the years away from town or cities. 
the beautiful lady is one of the most impressive grandchild in her family. not just beautiful but also hardworking, diligent, caring and humble because she still carry on her family's tradition and the lands. she learns all sorts of cooking, fermenting, recipes could be mostly from her grandparents which is oustanding. 
i too once lived like hers until i was 19 years old and i loves everything just like hers until my grandma passed away and the land was sold by my uncle that year. 
the memories i had never perish. i still remember the smell in the morning when i'm standing in the middle of the farm, the morning dewdrops on the leaves and grasses, the sounds of birds and water flowing in the small river, the bamboo forests in the evening like golden, chasing gooses, collecting the chicken eggs, collecting the sap from rubber trees, the soothing cold wind on the pepper farm hills, catching grasshoppers among the grasses, catching fireflies at night, the smell of firewood burning while boiling hot water, the food that my grandma used to cooked, my cousin shouting from afar teasing me while plucking potatoes from the ground, etc. i misses all that when i watched the video. 
i did went back to the village a few years ago but it wasnt the same anymore and the place changed alot and the farm wasnt like it used to be like. the peaceful life that i missed.","正如我们在视频中所看到的那样，森林，农场，院子，烹饪炉和餐具的背景是真实的。过去，尤其是对于中国人民，我们祖先在拥有的每一英寸土地上都在努力工作。他们利用自然界提供的一切。几代人的一代人的土地蓬勃发展。来自婴儿潮一代时代（像奶奶一样）的最后一代可能是同类的最后一代，因为由于现代和技术/gadjets世界的变化。 X，Y和Z一代在城市工作并居住在城市中，并大部分将老人/女人留在他们的村庄里，所以并没有多少人像视频中的生活那样过上生活。最后，离开土地和农场无人看管（因为爷爷/祖母已经在工作和照顾土地上已经老了）。
大多数人最终出售了他们的土地，以及新一代获得的资金投资于企业，在城市或另一个国家建造或翻新房屋等。
正如您在视频中看到的那样，您可以看到草药，干净的池塘和河流，各种植被，鸟类，鸡肉，鸭子等动物。这些是他们的日常食物来源，因为附近没有超市可以从那里购买。因此，如果您可以从自己的农场获得新鲜，为什么还需要购买呢？中国人在吃的东西（饮食和健康）中是特别的，因此他们种植了草药，蔬菜和活蛋。这就是婴儿潮一代在远离城镇或城市的几年中生存的方式。
美丽的女士是她家庭中最令人印象深刻的孙子之一。不仅美丽，而且勤奋，勤奋，关怀和谦虚，因为她仍然具有家人的传统和土地。她了解各种烹饪，发酵，食谱可能主要来自她的祖父母，这是罢工的。
我曾经像她一样像她一样生活，直到我19岁，我都喜欢像她这样的一切，直到我的祖母去世，那一年我的叔叔出售了这片土地。
我从未灭亡的记忆。我仍然记得早晨，当我站在农场中间时，早晨的气味，叶子和草地上的碎屑，小河中鸟类和水的声音，傍晚的竹林像金色一样，追逐鸡蛋，收集鸡蛋，从橡胶树中收集树液，在胡椒农场山上舒缓的冷风，在草中捕捉蚱hoppers，在晚上捕获萤火虫，柴火的气味在沸腾的热水时燃烧，食物，我是我的食物。奶奶曾经煮过，我的堂兄从远处大喊大叫，一边从地上摘下土豆，等等。
几年前，我确实回到了村庄，但不再一样，这个地方改变了很多，农场不像以前那样。我错过的和平生活。"

and yes, not all land is fertile, that's why you don't try to live in a desert like all the morons in arizona and many other places. you can turn many deserts into grassland: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpthi7o66pi&t=4s 

we grow fields upon fields upon fields of corn and soy to make garbage food that makes us sick while having useless lawns to show off to our neighbors that we can use a lawnmower when we could be making prime habitats for massive herds of animals that we can use as never ending food sources.

you can't afford to live off the land? that makes no sense, do you understand the concept here? you're living off the land, you don't need money.. nobody needs money for anything. it's worthless paper and digits in computers. you realize a couple hundred years ago people just rode wagons across america and picked a spot to settle right? i don't know the immediate answer to how to get land distributed to people who are willing to homestead, that's the hard part. i definitely wouldn't want the government involved. there is no easy solution for it, but the alternative is much worse. houses will be completely unaffordable throughout the world some day, and we'll all be even more of slaves to the corporate systems and governments than we already are. just wait, or just wait for your children to see... it's going to be a fucking nightmare. and it's going to happen, you're not getting the world to homestead, nobody is doing it. we're going the other direction and it's not stoppable.

ya, the population is growing, but as i said, you don't seem to have a clue how much land is out there, and people who cannot live off the land shouldn't be living.. why do you think we got into this situation? we cater to every little desire and whim of everybody all in the name of profit. if you have a strong family and community you can live off the land, anybody can do it, it's just a matter of not being a coddled sheltered half ass human being.

sure.. we've dug ourselves into a hole by chasing the dollars and carrots in front of our faces for centuries, but the solution has been staring us in the face the entire time.. most people are just too lazy and don't want to give up their lives of convenience for an honest living off the land. if you don't want an honest lifestyle living off the land and you want to live in a city full of conveniences and cancers then you're the problem. but you're in good company, probably 99% of people think that way. 

social backlash? like the social backlash from politics, unjust laws, and profiteering? just wait, you haven't even seen social backlash yet, this world is about to explode with social backlash. you're going to wish you had a homestead off the grid when it does.

the fact that i have to explain this to people shows how far gone the majority of mankind is. it's almost a shame that god has promised not to flood the earth again, we could really use a reset.","@johnvuu4679地球上有很多土地，你甚至在任何地方开车吗？您是否曾经离开过您居住的城市？与那里的城市相比，城市的规格很小。

是的，并非所有的土地都是肥沃的，这就是为什么您不像亚利桑那州和其他许多地方那样尝试生活在沙漠中的原因。您可以将许多沙漠变成草地：https：//www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpthi7o66pi&t=4S

我们在玉米和大豆的田地上种植田地，以制作垃圾食品，使我们生病，而无用的草坪可以向我们的邻居炫耀，我们可以在我们可以为大量动物群创造主要栖息地时使用割草机，我们可以使用割草机。用作永无止境的食物来源。

您负担不起居住的土地吗？那没有道理，您在这里了解这个概念吗？您在土地上生活，不需要钱..没人需要任何钱。这是毫无价值的纸和计算机中的数字。您意识到几百年前，人们只是骑着货车在整个美国都骑着货车，并选择了一个地点来定居吗？我不知道如何将土地分配给愿意居住的人的直接答案，这是困难的部分。我绝对不希望政府参与其中。没有简单的解决方案，但是替代方案更糟。有一天，全世界的房屋将完全负担不起，与我们现在相比，我们所有人都将成为公司系统和政府的奴隶。等一下，或者等待您的孩子看到...这将是一场他妈的噩梦。这将发生，您不会让世界进入宅基地，没有人在做。我们朝另一个方向前进，这是不可停止的。

是的，人口正在增长，但是正如我说的那样，您似乎不知道那里有多少土地，而无法生活的人不应该生存。这个情况？我们以利润的名义迎合每个人的每一个小小的渴望和兴起。如果您有一个强大的家庭和社区，您可以在土地上生活，任何人都可以做到这一点，这只是一个不做一个顽固的庇护半屁股人的问题。

当然..我们已经通过在脸前追着美元和胡萝卜数百年来挖掘了一个洞，但是解决方案一直在整个脸上盯着我们。想要放弃他们的便利生活，以诚实地生活在土地上。如果您不希望诚实的生活方式在土地上生活，而是想住在一个充满便利和癌症的城市中，那么您就是问题所在。但是您的公司很好，大概有99％的人以这种方式思考。

社交反弹？就像政治，不公正法律和盈利的社会反对一样？等一下，您甚至还没有看到社交反弹，这个世界即将在社交反弹的情况下爆炸。您将希望在电网上拥有一个宅基地。

我必须向人们解释这一事实，这表明了大多数人类已经走了多远。上帝已承诺不要再次淹没地球几乎是可惜的，我们可以真正使用重置。"

but showing the true appearance of rural china is not the theme of her video at all. the reason why you see such a beautiful video will cause discomfort because it subverts your impression of china, this is not china you know.
the real china should be messy and the people's quality is low. you are embarrassed and even painful for this. you instinctively resist the beautification of china, so you are skeptical of the video here.
many people have ""escaped"" or hope to ""escape"" china because of the status quo of contempt china. however, they may not expect that inferiority in their hometown will always be wrapped like a nightmare. when people enjoy the beauty and tranquility of li zihuan's video, they feel dislike and anger; when people admire china's development and progress, they will not have a hint of joy; a developed country feels that china's threats want to curb china some people even become accomplices. those who despise themselves are actually scornful. china is their demon, as long as they mention them, they will suffer.
i want to remind these people that 1.4 billion people living in china are also flesh and blood, and they are pursuing a happy and peaceful life. they also have their own creativity and imagination. why can't they create such high -level works? why can't china be beautiful?
those who feel that you are offended, if you are abroad, please leave this channel quietly, forget everything about china, and hope that you can live easily and have dignity. if you are in china, please open your eyes and look at everything around you, maybe more beautiful things are waiting for you to discover. even if you can't find it, spend more time to accompany your family, it is a beautiful thing.


——the above is just written to those chinese who have been demon","当你们觉得李子柒的视频是假的，中国的农村根本不是这个样子，我想对你们说，中国的农村确实不是这个样子。
但展示中国农村的真实面貌根本不是她视频的主题。你们之所以看到如此唯美的视频时会产生不适，是因为它颠覆了你们对中国的印象，这不是你们了解的中国。
真实的中国应该环境脏乱，人民素质低下。你们为此感到难堪，甚至痛苦。你们本能的抵制美化中国的事物，因此才对这里的视频持怀疑态度。
有许多人因为鄙夷中国的现状“逃出”了或希望“逃出”中国，然而他们也许没料到，对于自己故乡的自卑将永远如梦魇一般缠绕。在人们享受李子柒视频的唯美与恬静时，他们感到的是厌恶和愤怒；在人们赞叹中国的发展进步时，他们也不会有一丝喜悦；某发达国家感受到中国的威胁想要遏制中国时，有些人甚至成为了帮凶。那些鄙夷自己出身的人，其实也在鄙夷着自己。中国是他们的心魔，只要一提起他们就受煎熬。
我想提醒这些人，生活在中国的14亿人口，他们个个也都是有血有肉，他们都在追求幸福平静的生活。他们也都有各自的创造力和想象力，怎么就不能创造出这么高水平的作品来呢？中国怎么就不能有美好的事物了呢？
那些觉得自己受到冒犯的人，如果你身在国外，请你安静的离开这个频道，忘掉关于中国的一切，同时希望你活得轻松些，有尊严些。如果你身在国内，请你睁开眼重新打量一下周围的一切，也许还有更多美的事物等着你去发现。即便发现不了，多花些时间陪陪家人，也是美事一桩。

1089,Ugzl4rYjPHgbBj8vkcp4AaABAg,0,1 year ago,"faced with this person's heart more and more corrupted. the world where natural disasters and people are constantly, people have more and more conflicts, and more and more illegal things are. it is mentioned: you will hear the sound of fighting and fighting, don't panic. these things must be available, but the last period has not yet arrived. the people want to attack the people, the country must attack the country; there must be earthquakes and famines in many places. this is the beginning of disaster ...

in the distant past, the world of noah's life was like such corruption today. at that time, god regretted making people (all people thought at that time were all evil), so god wiped out with the floods (only stayed in staying (only stayed in staying because of his ""fear of god""), human ancestor adam, adam, chose to accept the temptation and did not follow god. from then on, he entered the world. today, our world, enjoy the convenience brought by technology, the emergence of the internet , make the world a global village, but people's relationships have become more complicated, violent porn information, etc., constantly seduce the world to sin, we live in a world of deceit happy, no longer respect others. this lifestyle makes us more and more farther away from god. it is also unpleasant to god. many people do not know the god who creates the universe or does not want to know god, does not want to know the gospel. it is superstitious, but the bible tells us that god was the versatile god that was in the past and eternal in the past, and god hated ""sin"". no longer the same, we have lost eternal life, life is limited, and god has set a day to judge the world according to the people (jesus) set up by his (jesus). god loves the world. the only sons jesus became a flesh, nailed to ten, and the life of our sinful life with his innocent life was resurrected three days after his death. sitting on the right of god jehovah, so that we could pardon through jesus, repentance and was baptized. the holy spirit believes that jesus becomes a savior, so that we have a new style, and then live according to the inspiration of the bible. jesus said: you have a lot of love for people, and you have more forgiveness. ; what amount do you use to give you, and what amount to use will be used to give you .. similar teaching bibles are inspired. if we are willing to obey, we will have the opportunity to save.

we live in the scientific era, and people no longer believe in god, but we can't see that it does not mean nothing. the busy life makes us have no time to think. what will we face after death? since the outbreak of the new crown virus, we are becoming more and more feeling the impermanence and fragility of life, jesus told us in lujia gospel: a sinner repent, and he must also happy for him in the sky, and he is more happy than ninety -nine righteous people who do not have to repent. god loves us to be close to him. we are all created in the style of god. we must never be punished because of sin, so the last days have been extended for a long time. they are looking for those who belong to him.
the gospel of john mentioned: jesus said, ""i am the road, truth, and life, and no one can get to the father if she doesn't use me.
dear friend, jesus christ is the grace of god. god's mercy on the world allows us to receive this grace in vain without paying any cost. the choice, please study the bible (with app) to understand god's grace and jesus' teaching of sin, or go to the church to understand the gospel, (there is a fake blessing to confuse the world, we need to distinguish it) family, i wish you peace.","面对这个人心愈来愈败坏ˋ天灾人祸不断的世界,人们冲突愈来愈多,不法的事情也愈来愈多,许多人的爱心渐渐冷淡,这些世界的景况,耶稣在马太福音里就有提到:你们将听见打仗和打仗的风声，不要惊慌。这些事是必须有的，只是末期还没有到。民要攻打民，国要攻打国；多处必有地震、饥荒。这都是灾难的起头..

在遥远的过去,挪亚生活的年代世界就犹如今天这样的败坏,当时神后悔造人(那时的人所思所想尽都是恶),于是神就用大洪水灭绝所有人(只有留下挪亚因为他""敬畏神""),人类祖先亚当ˋ夏娃选择接受诱惑而不顺从上帝,从此罪就入了世界,时至今日我们的世界,享受科技带来的便利性,网路的出现,让世界成为一个地球村,但是人们的关系也变的复杂,暴力ˋ色情资讯等等,不断的在诱惑世人犯罪,我们就生活一个诡诈ˋ谎言ˋ贪婪ˋ欲望无止境的世界里,人们追求自我快乐,不再尊重其他人,这样的生活方式让我们离上帝愈来愈遥远,也是上帝不喜悦的,很多人不清楚创造宇宙的上帝或者不想了解上帝,不想知道福音,认为时代那么进步这都是迷信,但是圣经告诉我们上帝是昔在ˋ今在ˋ以后永在的全能神,并且上帝恨恶""罪"",在亚当ˋ夏娃选择不顺从神的结果,让我们因为罪和圣洁的神属性不再一样,我们也失去永生,生命受到限制,而神已经定了日子，要借着祂所设立的人(耶稣)按公义审判天下,神爱世人.上帝在二千年前差了祂的独生子耶稣道成肉身,钉上十架,以祂无罪的生命代替我们有罪的生命赎罪,死后三天复活,坐在上帝耶和华神的右边,让我们可以借着耶稣罪得赦免,悔改ˋ受洗ˋ领受圣灵ˋ相信耶稣成为救主,让我们有新生的样式,之后按照圣经的启示来生活,耶稣说:您对人付出的爱多,您的赦免就多,你们怎样论断人，也必怎样被论断；你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们..类似的教导圣经都有启示,如果我们愿意顺服,都有机会得救.

我们活在科学时代,人不再相信有神,,不过看不到不代表没有,忙碌的生活让我们没有时间思考,人死后接下要面对什么?自从新冠病毒爆发以来,我们愈来愈感到生命的无常以及脆弱,耶稣在路加福音告诉我们:一个罪人悔改，在天上也要这样为他欢喜，较比为九十九个不用悔改的义人欢喜更大。神是喜爱我们亲近祂的,我们都是按着神的样式造的,绝对不要我们因为罪而受罚,所以末后的日子延长了很久,(耶稣离开2千年了)神要世人悔改归向祂,天天都在寻找归向祂的人.
约翰福音提到:耶稣说“我就是道路、真理、生命若不借着我，没有人能到父那里。
亲爱的朋友,耶稣基督就是神的恩典,神怜悯世人让我们不用付出什么代价就可以白白的领受这个恩典,末世的征兆愈来愈显明,在有限的生命里尽快的接受福音绝对是您最好的选择,恳请您研读圣经(有app)来了解神的恩典以及耶稣对罪的教导,或是到教会了解福音,(有假福音在迷惑世人,需要明辨)让我们一同进入神国的大家庭,祝平安ˋ喜乐."

❤ panai
everyone. all must be love. god overwhelmed.
together.

[easy to solve] as long as it is a person, it is similar, regardless of ethnic, human, gender, and religious beliefs, they should love each other. it is also the transformation of the heavens and the earth, and it should not be distinguished by you and me, and cooperate with each other to maintain this symbiotic and prosperous life community.
❤
those who are tall. the name is high. people are emphasized.
non -appearance. great person. look at it.
people are convinced. nothing.
❤
[easy to solve] the nobility of virtue is naturally high. everyone respects his virtue, not appearance. those who have talented people have excellent ability to deal with things, and their reputation is naturally extraordinary. however, what people admire and admire are his ability to do things, not because he is good at boasting.
❤
i have the ability. don't be selfish. people can.
don't be light. don't be rich. don't be proud.
don't hate it. don't like new. people are not idle.
don't stir. people are uneasy. don't disturb.

[easy to solve] when you have the ability to serve everyone, don't be selfish, just consider yourself, reluctant to pay. for the talents of others, you should learn, appreciate, and admire, not criticism, jealousy, and slander. don't please be rich, and don't be proud of themselves in front of the poor, or despise them. you should not like the new and hate the old. you must cherish old friends or old things, and do not be greedy for new friends or new things. when others are busy, don't disturb him. when others are in a bad mood or are physically and mentally arbitrary, don't gossip to interfere with him and increase his troubles and anxiety.
❤
people have short. don't unveil it. people have private.
don't say. taoist is good. that is good.
people know it. the more thoughtful. promote evil.
that is evil. different. mainly.
good persuasion. germany is built. out of irregularity.
two losses.

[easy to solve] don't expose the shortcomings of others. the privacy of others should not be publicized. the advantages or good deeds of praise of others are good deeds. when the other party hears your praise, it will definitely encourage good deeds. zhang yang's faults or disadvantages of others are to do evil. if criticism is too much, it will also recruit themselves. friends should have persuaded each other and build good moral cultivation together. if there are mistakes, you can't persuade each other, both of them will have defects.
❤
whenever. it is expensive. there are many.
take less. will add people. ask yourself first.
i don't want to. that is, ourselves. encounter.
forgotten. short resentment. the reward is long.

[easy to solve] the acquisition or granted of property must be clearly understood. it is better to give others more people. before you add things to others, or ask others to do things, you must ask yourself: ""if you change it to me, would i like it?"" if you do n’t even want to do it, you must stop immediately. remember to repay. others are sorry for themselves, and they should forget it. don't remember the resentment for too long in your heart, even if you're in the past. other people have to remember to be in mind, grateful, and often repay.
❤
wait for the servant. you are expensive. although expensive.
mercy and wide. attocked. no heart.
take care of people. fang wuyan.

[easy to solve] to treat the maids and servants in the home, we must pay attention to the righteousness and lead by example. although it is important, it is more valuable. if the battle is forced to obey, the other party will inevitably be convinced. only by serving people can others not complain.

the same person. elastic category. vulgar.
benevolence. relief. how fearful people are.
unexpectedly. the color is not charming. can kiss.
infinite. germany and japan advance. live days.
not kiss. infinite harm. villain enter.
bailing bad.

[easy to solve] it is also human, good, evil and evil, and mental heights are uneven. there are many people affected by the vulgarity, and there are few people with kindness and generosity. if they are really benevolent, everyone naturally fears him, because he speaks fair and selflessly without concealment, and does not please others, so everyone will naturally be awesome. those who can get close to rende and learn from him are very lucky, because he will make our virtue progress every day, and the fault will decrease one day. if you are not willing to get close to the gentlemen of the people, there will be endless scourge, because the unscrupulous villain will approach us while it is false, and our words and deeds will be affected by bad words, and even the whole life will enter the wrong direction.

文 ❤ 
do not work. but learn text. long flashy.
whoever. but do it. don't learn text.
let's see it. amazing.

[easy to solve] can't do filial piety, 悌, jin, faith, pan -loving, and relatives, and blindly study. even if there are some knowledge, it is just a habit that has increased its fascinating and unrealistic. what is the use? if you just keep your teachings and refuse to study, it is easy to do it because of unknown things and cause mistakes according to your own prejudice. this is also wrong.

reading. three arrives. eye.
believe. read this. don't admire.
this is not the end. don't get up. width is limited.
tightly use it. worked. stady.
suspicious. sui notes. just ask.
seeking meaning.

[easy to solve] the method of reading should be focused on three arrival: eye, mouth, and heart, the three are indispensable, so that the effect of getting more effort can be received. study science must be dedicated to deepen, and you ca n’t start reading this book before it can be read. he also enviouss other books and wants to read other books. this will never be able to read a book in depth. you must read this book to read another one. when setting a reading plan, you may wish to relax. in actual implementation, you must step up hard work and strictly implement it. you must not be lazy. the daily accumulation of the month was deeply worked, and the original unreasonable and doubtful doubts were naturally solved. when you have any questions in your heart, you should take notes at any time. as soon as you have a chance, you should ask the good teacher yiyou. be sure to understand its true meaning.

the room is clear. the wall is clean. several cases are clean.
the pen is zheng. ink grind. both heart.
the word is disrespectful. heart disease. list of classics.
there is a fixed. after reading. restore.
although there is anxiety. crushed. there is a shortage.
just make up. non -holy books. don't look at the screen.
well. bad heart. don't violently.
don't give up. holy and xian. tame.

[easy to solve] the study should be sorted and cleaned, and the walls should be kept clean. when reading, stationery such as pen and ink, paper, and other stationery should be neat and messy, and all of them are in order to calm down to read. the ancients should use a brush to write ink first. if they were absent, the ink would be missed. if the words written are crooked, it means that you are impetuous and your heart cannot be determined. books should be divided into different categories, arranged neatly, placed in a fixed position, and they must be returned to the restore place after reading. although there is an urgent matter to leave, take the book and leave it before leaving. the book is the crystallization of wisdom. if there is a defect, it must be repaired and keeps complete. it is not a book that preach the words and deeds of sages and bad books that are harmful to physical and mental health. they should abandon and not read, so as not to be polluted, wisdom, and ambitions to become unhealthy. when you encounter difficulties or setbacks, don't abandon yourself, don't have to be cynical, complain about the world, you should be angry and study hard. although the realm of sages is high, it can be achieved in order. ❤

disciples are easy to solve (end)
title: disciples three -character sutra
filial scriptures are easy to solve. welcome to print.
❤ minglun teach filial piety
read thousands of times. it is self -explanatory.
implement life. it really does.

the disciples' name is ""xunmengwen"", which was made by li yuxiu, a talented talent in the kangxi period of the qing dynasty. its content adopts the sixth articles of ""the analects of confucius"": ""the disciples enter the filial piety, and they are brothers, and they believe in the people, and they love the public, and they have the power to learn."" sentence yiyun compilation is divided into five parts to perform; specifically listed on the etiquette and norms that the children are at home, out of the country, taking care of people, studying, and studying. later, after the revision of jia cunren in the qing dynasty, it was renamed ""disciples regulations"". it was the best reading of enlightenment and educating children dunlun to prevent evil and consciousness, and develop a loyal family style.
title: changli
1. family affairs, do not say to outsiders.
for example, if you talk about the economic situation at home, the place where your family usually goes out, or when the family is expected to go, in case of the thief or someone who is interested, they will break through the empty door and do bad things.
in addition, the ancients said that the family was ugly. if complains and accusing their families of listening to outsiders, others could not help you solve the problem. it would not only hurt the dignity of the family, but also made outsiders impress your family. or outsiders pass the housework you said as a gossip. if the sky is chaotic and then spread back to your ears, it will not only be unable to argue, but also increase the family's heart.

2. buddhism: knowing that more methods are actually giving.
❤ faiba: wisdom and wisdom.
i often read the ancient sage books and do their best. let the general public pay attention to moral cultivation and distinguish between right and wrong, so that they will not argue with others or sin.
❤ 富。。.
foreign wealth is something outside of the body, money, clothes, food, etc., provided to those in need.
inner wealth is his own body. at home, we help our family to do housework, serve our family with our bodies, and help the poor to help the poor disadvantage. this is all fortune. only can it be available.
❤ the fearless giving is the reason, the obtained fruit is healthy and longevity.
everything is terrifying, fearful, and threatened by life. you help him leave all horror and let him be physically and mentally stable. this is called fearless giving.

3. see the person who is lost, don't say proud.
(those who understand the feelings of others can always think about others.)
when he encounters frustrated, sad, and lost people, he has been hit in all aspects and is very unhappy. it should be said that he can comfort him, instead of saying how much he is.
when others break their fortunes and lose their jobs, you say that you are promoted to get rich, which will make the other party even more unbearable. pride and pride itself is evil, let alone hurt people?
on the contrary, the mood that can be eliminated by others' nervousness or anxiety is good. even if you ca n’t help you, do n’t go down. don't do it because of goodness, don't do it because of evil.
it is not only violence and crime called evil deeds. the evil thoughts that people often can't stop are the source of disaster.
welcome to print. bleak","弟子规（3）
❤泛爱众
凡是人。皆须爱。天同覆。
地同载。

【易解】 只要是人，就是同类，不分族群、人种、性别、宗教信仰，皆应相亲相爱。同是天地所化育覆载的，应该不分你我，互助合作，才能维持这个共生共荣的生命共同体。
❤
行高者。名自高。人所重。
非貌高。才大者。望自大。
人所服。非言大。
❤
【易解】 德行高尚者，名望自然高显，大家所敬重的是他的德行，不是外表容貌。有才能的人，处理事情的能力卓越，声望自然不凡，然而人们所欣赏佩服的，是他的处事能力，而不是因为他擅于夸耀。
❤
己有能。勿自私。人所能。
勿轻訾。勿谄富。勿骄贫。
勿厌故。勿喜新。人不闲。
勿事搅。人不安。勿话扰。

【易解】 当你有能力可以为众人服务的时候，不要自私自利，只考虑到自己，舍不得付出。对于他人的才华，应当学习、欣赏、赞叹，而不是批评、嫉妒、毁谤。不要去讨好巴结富有的人，也不要在穷人面前骄傲自大，或者轻视他们。更不可以喜新厌旧，对于老朋友或旧事物要珍惜，对于新朋友或新事物不要贪恋。当别人正在忙碌的时候，不要去打扰他，当别人心情不好或身心欠安的时候，不要闲言闲语去干扰他，增加他的烦恼与不安。
❤
人有短。切莫揭。人有私。
切莫说。道人善。即是善。
人知之。愈思勉。扬人恶。
即是恶。疾之甚。祸且作。
善相劝。德皆建。过不规。
道两亏。

【易解】 别人的缺点，不要去揭穿。别人的隐私，切忌去张扬。赞美他人的优点或善行，就是行善。当对方听到你的称赞之后，必定会更加勉励行善。张扬他人的过失或缺点，就是行恶，如果指责批评太过分了，还会给自己招来灾祸。朋友之间应该互相规过劝善，共同建立良好的品德修养。如果有错不能互相规劝，两个人的品德都会有缺陷。
❤
凡取与。贵分晓。与宜多。
取宜少。将加人。先问己。
己不欲。即速己。恩欲报。
怨欲忘。报怨短。报恩长。

【易解】 财物的取得或给予，一定要分办清楚明白，宁可多给别人，自己少拿一些，才能广结善缘，与人和睦相处。要将事物加到别人身上，或要托别人做事之前，先要反问自己：「如果换成是我，我愿意吗？」如果连自己都不愿意，就要立刻停止。受人恩惠要记得报答。别人有对不起自己的事，应该宽大为怀把它忘掉。怨恨不平的事不要记在心中太久，过去就算了。别人对我们的恩德，则要铭记在心，感恩不忘，常思报答。
❤
待婢仆。身贵端。虽贵端。
慈而宽。势服人。心不然。
理服人。方无言。

【易解】 对待家中的婢女与仆人，要注重自己的品行端正并以身作则。虽然品行端正很重要，但是仁慈宽大更可贵。如果仗势强逼别人服从，对方难免口服心不服。唯有以理服人，别人才会心悦诚服没有怨言。

同是人。类不齐。流俗众。
仁者希。果仁者。人多畏。
言不讳。色不媚。能亲仁。
无限好。德日进。过日少。
不亲仁。无限害。小人进。
百事坏。

【易解】 同样是人，善恶邪正、心智高低却是良莠不齐。受风气流俗影响的人多，仁慈宽厚的人少。如果是真正有仁德的人，大家自然敬畏他，因为他说话公正无私没有隐瞒，又不讨好他人，所以大家自然会起敬畏之心。能够亲近仁德的人，向他学习，是很幸运的事，因为他会使我们的德行一天比一天进步，过错也跟着一天天减少。如果不肯亲近仁人君子，就会有无穷的祸害，因为不肖的小人会趁虚来接近我们，日积月累，我们的言行思想都会受到不良的影响，甚至使整个人生走入错误的方向。


不力行。但学文。长浮华。
成何人。但力行。不学文。
任己见。昧理真。

【易解】 不能身体力行孝、悌、谨、信、泛爱众、亲仁这些本分，一味死读书，纵然有些知识，也只是增长自己浮华不实的习气，变成一个不切实际的人，如此读书又有何用？如果只是谨守教诲，却不肯读书学习，就容易因不明事理，而依自己的偏见行事，造成错误而不自知，这也是不对的。

读书法。有三到。心眼口。
信皆要。方读此。勿慕彼。
此未终。彼勿起。宽为限。
紧用功。工夫到。滞塞通。
心有疑。随札记。就人问。
求确义。

【易解】 读书的方法要注重三到：眼到、口到、心到，三者缺一不可，如此方能收到事半功倍的效果。研究学问要专一、专精才能深入，不能这本书才开始读没多久，又欣羡其他的书，想看其他的书，这样永远也定不下心把一本书好好深入读通。必须把这本书读完，才能再读另外一本。在订定读书计画的时候，不妨宽松一些，实际执行时，就要加紧用功，严格执行，不可以懈怠偷懒。日积月累功夫深了，原先窒碍不通、困顿疑惑之处，自然而然都迎刃而解了。求学当中，心里有疑问时，应随时笔记，一有机会，就向良师益友请教，务必确实明白它的真义。

房室清。墙壁净。几案洁。
笔砚正。墨磨偏。心不端。
字不敬。心先病。列典籍。
有定处。读看毕。还原处。
虽有急。卷束齐。有缺坏。
就补之。非圣书。屏勿视。
蔽聪明。坏心志。勿自暴。
勿自弃。圣与贤。可驯致。

【易解】 书房要整理清洁，墙壁要保持干净。读书时，书桌上笔墨纸砚等文具要摆放整齐不凌乱，触目所及皆是井然有条，才能静下心来读书。古人写字使用毛笔先要磨墨，如果心不在焉，墨就会磨偏了。写出来的字如果歪歪斜斜，就表示你浮躁不安，心定不下来。书本应该分门别类，排列整齐，放在固定的位置，阅读完毕须归还原处。虽有急事要离开，也要把书本收好再离开。书本是智慧的结晶，有缺损就要修补，保持完整。不是传述圣贤言行的著作，以及有害身心健康的不良书刊，都应该摒弃不看，以免身心受到污染、智慧遭受蒙蔽、心志变得不健康。遇到困难或挫折的时候，不要自暴自弃，也不必愤世嫉俗、怨天尤人，应该发愤向上努力学习。圣贤境界虽高，循序渐进，也是可以达到的。 ❤

弟子规易解（终）
书名：弟子规 三字经 
孝经 易解。欢迎翻印。
❤明伦教孝
读书千遍。其意自现。
落实生活。确实做到。

弟子规原名＜训蒙文＞，为清朝康熙年间秀才李毓秀所作。其内容采用《论语》学而篇第六条：「弟子入则孝，出则弟，谨而信，泛爱众，而亲仁，行有余力，则以学文。」的文义以三字一句，两句一韵编纂而成，分为五个部份加以演述；具体列举出为人子弟在家、出外、待人接物、求学应有的礼仪与规范，特别讲求家庭教育与生活教育。后经清朝贾存仁修订改编，并改名为＜弟子规＞，是启蒙养正，教育子弟敦伦尽份防邪存诚，养成忠厚家风的最佳读物。
书名：常礼举要
1.家庭之事，不可向外人言。
举例来说，如果你讲到家里的经济状况、家人平常出入的地点，或是什么时间家人预计要去哪里，万一被小偷或是有心人士打听到了，他们会闯空门、做坏事。
另外，古人说家丑不可外扬，若是抱怨、指责家人给外人听，别人也不能帮你解决问题，不仅会伤害家人的尊严，也让让外人对你们一家印象不佳。又或者外人把你说的家务事都当成闲谈八卦传出去，若是说得天花乱坠再传回你耳中，不仅百口莫辩，也徒增一家人心里难受。

2.佛教：知道得到更多的方法其实是布施。
❤法布施：得聪明智慧。
常常读古圣贤书，并身体力行。让社会大众能够注重品德修养，能够分辨是非，才不会与人争执或是犯罪。
❤财布施得财富、功德。
外财就是身外之物，钱、衣服、食物等，提供给需要的人。
内财是自己身体。我们在家里面，帮助家人做家事，用我们的身体为家人服务，在外做义工帮助贫困弱势这都是财布施。能舍才有得。
❤无畏布施是因，得到的果报是健康长寿。
万物有恐怖、有畏惧、生命受到威胁，你帮助他离开一切恐怖，让他身心安稳，这叫无畏布施。

3.见失意人，不说得意语。
（明白别人感受的人总是能够多为别人着想呢。）
遇到失意、伤心、失落的人，他各方面都受到打击，很不得意，应该说点让他得到安慰的话，而不是说自己有多在行、多厉害。
当别人破了财，丢了工作，你却说自己升官发财，这会让对方更加不堪忍受。傲慢、骄傲本身即是恶，更何况用来伤人？
相反的，能够免除别人紧张恐惧或是忧虑的心情即是善，即便帮不上忙也千万不要落井下石。勿因善小而不为，勿因恶小而为之。
并非只有暴力、犯罪才叫恶行，人常常止不住的恶念也是灾难的源头。

the biggest reason is here. please take a look. compared with the chinese government ruled by the communist party, how much tax rate does it receive?
take a look at the following links, click [list], there is the national flag, and see the mahoga communist party's zhao family. the [corporate income tax] ""only"" ""only"" you can collect 68%tax.
it is right, that is, the goods you bought, before you see it, the communist party has already harvested you 68%of the cost. after seeing the product, plus about 13%of consumption tax. the personal income made by the chives hard, and they simply gave them the zhao family of the communist party. really, to call the communist party's zhao family's first place in the world. the item of ""corporate income tax"" of lights in big countries really has no country.
no wonder in the pseudo -mawei communist party ruled the western korean wall, chinese prices can be seen everywhere [super british catching the united states]. leeks are cut and cut at any time.
