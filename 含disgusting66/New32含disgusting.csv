shouldn't you questioning about what you have been told by the western media now? you are so self-righteous to say people are worldview distorted and brainwashed bla bla by only knowing that i'm a chinese and i speak for china. look who is brainwashed now? i think a mature adult should know to see things dialectically. we or i never say that xi made himself president for life is right or good. actually we were very upset with this even though we know that chinese political system is originally not democratic. but after thinking about the time when all my americans friends had to choose a worse president out of the worst, and the time when the british ordinary voted for brexit but was shocked by the result because they were suppose to vote it for fun, i do think that it might not be a bad thing. because ordinary people have no idea what and who they are voting(americans votes for what they have been promised by the candidates, but god knows if the promises can really became real. most of the time they are fulled by the candidates, or in the end the voted president didn't make his promise come true if though they might want to keep his promises). if xi is a good president and can lead the chinese to better economy and a more united country, why could let him be a life president? i know you would start your noble democracy literature like other westerners. but fuck off democracy! democracy is not the only right way to run a country. actually, is democracy a right way is a good question as well. look at how the democracy has decreased or stopped the economy in most western countries! even america, look at how old their highways are and the terrible road conditions; the average annually income hasn't change much in 10 years, not even mentioning other western countries. they are falling. i like what the former president of singapore lee kuan yew said: countries like us who need to catch up do not need democracy. we have to gather our resources and use it to one and only goal. that is what suitable for us. and now look at what a marvelous country he managed to build from nothing! no homeless, super safe society with diverse culture and people from different background. thus your democracy doesn't work and suits others. don't be bully judging others by thinking only your way is the right way. that is very immature thought. but you are not immature in only that aspect, look at how funny you said about nathan rich. he said things you didn't familiar but contradict to what you thought then you said this person has no integrity but just to please the chinese. why do you stop trying to be a truth-fighter now by criticizing about his content but instead to attack this person? cause you know you don't have the ability to say it out loud that what he had said was unreal. you want to but you cannot.only i and other who truly have ever lived in china can have that right to say if what he said is true or fake. we were arguing if the content in the western media is true or not right? why come to nathan rich's videos, you switched to just subjectively judging a person instead of arguing the objective video contents? so stop lecturing about your so called ""freedom of speech"" cause it's actually not existing in america either. youtube's algorithms has set limits to the reviews of videos which contents the authority don't want you to see. so don't be childish, believe what you have seen by your real eyes. that's why i recommend nathan rich's videos cause the chinese current situations described by him is the one i know of and experienced. i live outside china but i do go back every now and then. i worked and lived in the states from 2012-2018 in a world top tech company having top 5-10% american annually income, but i still feel the huge problems of american society. the extreme white left politicians, the stupid law of letting the criminals to go away if the assets amount they get from robbery or stealing is under $975, the unavoidable frequent car window broking robbery, the drug problem, the disgusting streets of sf with homeless and their shits. your democracy just don't work that well, ok? just accept the truth that not everyone want this and they can live a good life without this. after my american greencard application got current, i had to make a choice if i really wanted to live here and raised my child in a society like this. our answer was no and my family voted by our own feet--we moved out of the states. so all the above came from a person who had really lived in both china and america, sorry to let you down and snapped your face about your brainwashed and worldview distorted conclusion. but if you insist by saying this poor chinese is just so deeply brainwashed even your great truth teller western media couldn't save her back in 7 years, feel free to say so.",@oc-cpa终于在回复的最后一个回复中提出了一个很好的问题吗？是的，为什么一个没有言论自由或新闻自由的痛苦的中国人甚至会出现在本网站上？您现在不应该质疑西方媒体所告诉您的内容吗？您是如此自以为是，以至于人们只知道我是中国人，而我为中国说话，人们就被世界观扭曲和洗脑了。看谁现在被洗脑了？我认为一个成熟的成年人应该知道辩证的事情。我们或我从未说过习近平使自己终身总统是正确的。实际上，即使我们知道中国政治制度本来不是民主的，我们对此感到非常沮丧。但是，在考虑了我所有的美国人朋友都必须从最糟糕的情况下选择更糟糕的总统的时间，而英国普通人投票赞成英国脱欧，但对结果感到震惊，因为他们本来应该投票赞成娱乐，我确实如此认为这可能不是一件坏事。因为普通人不知道他们在投票的是什么（美国人都投票赞成候选人所承诺的东西，但上帝知道承诺是否真的可以变得真实。在大多数情况下，他们都被候选人或在结束选票的总统不会做出他的诺言，尽管他们可能想兑现他的诺言）。如果习近平是一名好总统，可以带领中国人走向更好的经济和更加统一的国家，为什么让他成为终身总统？我知道您会像其他西方人一样开始您的崇高民主文学。但是，滚蛋民主！民主并不是经营一个国家的唯一正确方法。实际上，民主是正确的方法也是一个很好的问题。看看大多数西方国家的民主如何减少或阻止经济！甚至美国，看看他们的高速公路年龄多大和可怕的道路状况。每年的平均收入在10年内没有变化太大，甚至没有提及其他西方国家。他们跌倒了。我喜欢新加坡前总统李·库恩（Lee Kuan Yew）所说的：像我们这样的国家，需要赶上的国家不需要民主。我们必须收集我们的资源，并将其用于一个唯一的目标。那就是适合我们的。现在看看他设法从一无所有地建立了一个奇妙的国家！没有各种文化和来自不同背景的人的无家可归，超级安全的社会。因此，您的民主不起作用并适合他人。不要通过仅思考自己的方式来欺负他人是正确的方法。那是非常不成熟的想法。但是，您并不是在这方面并不成熟，请看看您对Nathan Rich的说法有多有趣。他说您不熟悉的事情，但与您的想法相矛盾，然后您说这个人没有诚信，而只是为了取悦中国人。为什么您现在不再试图通过批评他的内容而试图成为真相战斗机，而要攻击这个人？因为您知道您没有能力大声说出他所说的是虚幻的。您想，但您不能。只有我和其他曾经住在中国的人可以说他说的是真的还是假的。我们在争论西方媒体中的内容是正确的吗？为什么要参加内森·里奇（Nathan Rich）的视频，您改用了主观评判一个人而不是争论客观视频内容？因此，不要再对您所谓的“言论自由”进行讲授，因为它实际上也不存在于美国。 YouTube的算法已设定了视频评论的限制，该视频内容不希望您看到。因此，不要幼稚，相信您的真实眼睛所看到的。这就是为什么我推荐内森·里奇（Nathan Rich）的视频，原因是他所描述的中国当前情况是我知道和经历的。我住在中国以外，但我不时地回去。从2012年至2018年，我在一家世界顶级科技公司中工作并居住在美国，每年获得5-10％的美国收入，但我仍然感到美国社会的巨大问题。极端白人左派政客，如果他们从抢劫或偷窃的资产金额不到975美元，那是让罪犯离开的愚蠢法律，这是不可避免的经常发生的车窗经纪抢劫，毒品问题，令人恶心他们的狗屎。您的民主制度不太好，好吗？只要接受并非每个人都想要这个的事实，没有这个，他们就可以过上美好的生活。在我的美国绿色申请中申请后，如果我真的想住在这里并在这样的社会中抚养我的孩子，我必须做出选择。我们的回答是否定的，我的家人用自己的脚投票 - 我们搬出了美国。因此，以上所有内容都来自一个真正生活在中国和美国的人，很抱歉让您失望，并为您的洗脑和世界观扭曲了结论。但是，如果您坚持说这个可怜的中国人被深深地洗脑了，即使您的伟大真相teller teller teller媒体无法在7年内拯救她，请随时这样说。
