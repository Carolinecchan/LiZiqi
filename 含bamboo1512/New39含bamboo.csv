22055,Ugxlko-aCv8bm3F_QJp4AaABAg,5,3 years ago,"recently, li ziyi has been the ""ambassador to the promotional ambassador of the rural rural rural rural rich"", which has triggered a new round of comment boom. after seeing some, i couldn't help but feel like i could provide different perspectives.

the point is, i hope that everyone is calm, discuss things, and try to listen to it as much as possible.

don't bully a diligent, brave and intelligent girl.

according to the good cat catching the mouse, li ziyi is not an outstanding good cat. not to mention the renminbi income, she made a lot of money on the international stage, about tens of thousands of dollars a day, envy everyone, realize her dream of serving her grandmother's life, and obtaining the harvest of no dare to expect. impressive.

nearly 8 million foreign fans, everyone shows the truth, kindness showing the video. unconvinced? if you try it, you will know. jiang feng, the most popular self -media chinese, has subscribed for 280,000, is already an example for many people. it's just 3%of this little girl.

the videos of overseas cattle guo wengui are only watched tens of thousands of people every time. li ziyi's video is five or six million. the best 30 million. the video three years ago was searched every day, and the number of clicks continued to skyrocket.

this is not a general miracle.

i spent the strength of nine niu and tiger to make a video. so far, i only have 160 subscriptions, and the best video is watching more than 1,000 people.

i know li ziyi's weight. everyone also weighs.

everyone has the most discussions. the most misunderstanding of li ziyi is that she is just an actor, and her work is made by a huge team.

please understand her development history a little.

li ziyi had a childhood young man who had been unable to look back, had various workers, and had a long period of time for a person's exploration of experiments. he finally rely on his talents, hard work, hard work, and succeed.

the current situation, i am afraid that zhang yimou is likely to be a director. of course, li ziyi does not need zhang yimou. i have an analogy. li ziyi has no self -learning talent, and the artistic talent shown is no worse than zhang yimou.

li ziyi rely on his own efforts to come to this day. you open your eyes and talk nonsense, and you are unwilling to do basic investigations and research. he maliciously pour dirty girls to a hard -working girl.

really blushing for you. be kind. do nโ€t be so rude and hateful.

true: li ziyi's true, not that she is too beautiful, not what kind of shoes are wearing in the farmland. in my eyes, li zizhen's true, manifested in her hard work, hard work, and manifested in her soul. nothing will do.

of course, she will not seriously and deliberately express the hardships of the peasants in sichuan and the sufferings of rural poor today. li ziyi is pursuing the amount of subscriptions and click volume. her performance is basically impeccable.

li ziyi truly shows her own pursuit of life and her own state of life.

of course, try your best to beautify. otherwise, where can i subscribe?

good: see her depending on the grandmother's life, and take care of each other. thinking that grandma finally got a good life, she was really happy.

thinking of my work hard for a whole life. li ziyi's kindness is one of the biggest highlights of the video.

beauty: needless to say. i admire me and admire from the bottom of my heart. some people will say, team teams, foreign announcements and so on.

you just need to see li ziyi's earliest video to feel her artistic talent.

besides: with the current situation of li ziyi's current daily gold, let alone the government, any of the people with funds will not hesitate to make a behind -the -scenes team.

dawai xuan:

where is this? what big publicity? what a crime is to have no words. a girl mixed with meals, accidentally red and purple, do nโ€t tm โ€s blind eyes?

but here to tell the government and the communist youth league, do not speculate. stir good things. what is the blind ginseng?

the government was not stupid, and i saw li ziyi's success and wanted to use it. in fact, maybe good intentions have become bad things. with my concept, the government, the communist youth league, the best leave her alone. it is not as good as the last four, truth, goodness and beauty.

ziyi, please be careful. no need to cooperate too deeply with the government. tell them to let you develop freely in accordance with their greatest interests. otherwise, the end may not be good for anyone.

cut!

during the seven years of labor in rural areas during the revolution, the hardships of the rural areas of china's rural areas know a little.

the reason why li ziyi feels is because most of the farm work that li ziyi has done has done it, and i will even accept the soles of the shoe. i rushed the cow to rake the ground in the paddy field, and i tried it. if you can't try it, you have to give it to the poor farmers around him. very difficult work. i did not dry the back of the mountain from the mountain. there are no bamboo or mountains there. almost all of the others can't be familiar. rice, wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, pigs and sheep beef, planting vegetables. we do not plant fruit trees. moving the bricks by myself and moving the bricks. at the age of seventeen, he was cooking for fifteen students.

li ziyi used bamboo to make a sofa for me too much. too admire!

ziyi, refueling ๅฟ…๏ธ do not worry about it. take your own way and let others have a way. don't ignore some people's words of talking nonsense.

ps

ziyi does not necessarily know the history of 12 million people starved in sichuan during the great famine. mianyang is the hardest hit area. please know. it is important to your future development.","最近李子柒担任“中国农村青年致富带头人推广大使”，引发新一轮评论热潮。看了一些，忍俊不禁，有感而发，希望能够提供不同视角。

关键是，希望大家平心静气，就事论事，尽量做到兼听则明。

不要语言欺凌一个勤劳勇敢聪慧的女孩子。

按照逮着老鼠就是好猫的说法，李子柒不啻是一只杰出的极其优秀的好猫。不说人民币收入，她大把大把的在国际舞台上赚美元，大概每天几万美元吧，羡煞众人，实现自己养家糊口侍奉奶奶的人生梦想，获得原本不敢奢望的收获，可喜可贺令人钦佩。

将近800万外国粉丝，大家是冲着视频展现的真善美来的。不服气？你试试就知道了。海外最红的自媒体华人江峰，28万订阅，已经是很多人崇拜的榜样。仅仅是这小姑娘的3%。

海外牛人郭文贵每次的视频也只是几万人看。李子柒的视频动辄五六百万。最好的3千万。三年前的视频还在被人每天搜索，点击量继续暴涨。

这可不是一般的奇迹。

我费了九牛二虎之力做视频，至今只有160订阅量，最好的一个视频1000多人观看。

我知道李子柒的分量。大家也掂量掂量。

大家议论最多，对李子柒误解最大的是，她不过是个演员，工作都是一个庞大的团队做的。

请稍微了解一下她的发展史。

李子柒有过不堪回首的童年少年，有过各种打工经验，有过很长时间一个人摸索实验失败，最后靠自己的才华，勤奋，努力，获得了成功。

现在状况，恐怕邀请张艺谋来做导演都有可能。当然李子柒不需要张艺谋我是打个比方。李子柒无师自通自学成才，表现出来的艺术天分，不比张艺谋差一丝一毫。

李子柒完全靠自己的努力走到今天。你们睁着眼睛瞎说八道，连基本的调查研究都不愿意做，恶意向一个勤劳致富的女孩子泼脏水。

真替你们脸红。Be kind. Don’t be so rude and hateful.

真：李子柒的真，不是表现在她穿着过于漂亮，不是表演在穿着什么样的鞋子在农田里劳作。在我的目光里，李子柒的真，表现在她的勤劳，吃苦耐劳，表现在她的心灵手巧。啥都会干。

她当然不会去认真刻意的表现四川绵阳农民的辛苦和今日农村贫困人群的苦难。李子柒追求的是订阅量，点击量。她的表现基本无懈可击。

李子柒真实的表现了她自己对生活的追求，她自己的生活状态。

当然要尽力美化。不然哪里来订阅量？

善：看她和奶奶相依为命，互相关照。想到奶奶终于过上好日子真为子柒高兴。

想起自己姥姥勤劳一生。李子柒的善良，是视频最大亮点之一。

美：毋庸赘言。令我感佩，从心底里佩服。有人又会说了，团队团队，大外宣等等。

你只需要去看看李子柒最早的视频就能感觉到她的艺术天分。

再说一遍：以李子柒目前日进斗金的状况，别说政府，任何一个有资金的人都会毫不犹豫甘作幕后团队。

大外宣：

这哪儿跟哪儿啊？什么大外宣？真是欲加之罪 何患无辞。一个女孩子混口饭吃，不小心大红大紫，别TM的瞎着眼胡说八道好不好？

但是此处敬告政府和共青团，别投机不成舍把米。把好事搅合了。瞎参和什么呢？

政府不傻，看到李子柒的成功趁机想利用起来。其实也许好心办成坏事儿。以我的观念，政府啊共青团啊什么的最好leave her alone. 免得最后四不像，真善美不在。

子柒也请慎重。不必和政府合作太深。告诉他们让你自由发展符合他们的最大利益。不然最后也许结局对谁都不好。

切切！

在下文革时期在农村劳动七年多，对中国农村的苦难农民的艰辛略知一二。

之所以感觉李子柒的真实，就是因为李子柒干过的农活儿大部分我都干过，我甚至会纳鞋底。赶着牛在水田里耙地，我试过。怎么试都不行只好交给身边的贫农代表。很不容易的活计。从山上砍竹子背下山没有干过。我们那里没有竹子也没有山。其它几乎都再熟悉不过。水稻，小麦，玉米，红薯，养猪羊牛，种菜。我们没有种水果树。自己盖房子搬砖头用手推车运转头。十七岁当炊事员专职为十五个同学做饭。

李子柒用竹子做沙发让我太佩服了。太佩服！

子柒，加油

PS

子柒不一定知道大饥荒时期四川饿死1200万人的历史。绵阳是重灾区。请一定了解一下。对你今后发展至关重要。"

she also had an adult dog a year ago who disappeared from the vids and two puppies showed up recently with a lamb. are these dogs props, personal pets, or livestock?

that weibo is her target audience is irrelevant to my skepticism. but, since we’re on that topic, it’s obvious she’s branching out to youtube because she gets paid when she has youtube advertisers. plus, she can probably make more from youtube than she can make from weibo.

and, yes, we shouldn't believe everything on the internet and her videos are a glaring reason why we shouldn't. a typical youtuber share a day in his/her everyday life by not contriving and fictionalizing it to the degree and frequency that it’s probably happening in her vids and without acknowledging it to the viewer.

i'd enjoy the cinematography more if i'm not shaking my head in disbelieve at some of the antics.","@christiannugraha1011我认识到她拖着竹子而不是抬起，这就是我写“拖动”的原因。我想知道她是否甚至住在竹林附近。在其他视频中，我们认为她的房子位于山上，而不是山上。在这个vid中，她拍摄的是将这60英尺的竹竿拖到大型田地上。即使竹林确实在她的房子里“下一个”生长，显然这不是她希望听众根据所提供的图像相信的（例如，将60'的竹杆拖到田野上的“山丘”上，向上拖动“山。”）她希望观众相信自己可以劳作和辛劳，而且看起来仍然完美无缺，没有汗水，没有一束不合适的，她的脸和手上没有污垢，而奇迹般地保留了那只口红，也没有 - 制成化妆看起来。

一年前，她还有一只成年狗，他从视频中消失了，最近有两只幼犬出现在羔羊身上。这些狗道具，个人宠物还是牲畜？

微博是她的目标受众，与我的怀疑主义无关。但是，由于我们在这个主题上，很明显，她正在YouTube分支机构，因为当她拥有YouTube广告客户时她会得到报酬。另外，她可能从YouTube中获得的比微博所能获得的更多。

而且，是的，我们不应该相信互联网上的所有内容，她的视频是我们不应该不应该的明显原因。一个典型的YouTuber在他/她的日常生活中分享了一天的一天，因为它不考虑和虚构的程度和频率，可能会发生在她的视频中，而没有向观众承认它。

如果我不对某些滑稽动作不相信自己的头，我会更喜欢摄影。"
