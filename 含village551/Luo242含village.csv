3065,UgxK7tTx9vC9pt59mmJ4AaABAg,634,1 year ago (edited),"as we can see in the videos, the background of the forest, farms, yards, cooking stoves and utensils are real. in the past especially for the chinese people our ancestors work hard on every inch of lands they have. they make use of everything that nature provides to them. generation by generations the land grew flourish. this final generation from baby boomers era (like the grandma) likely the last of their kind, because due to the changes of modern and tech/gadjets world. not many still living up the life just like showed in the video because the generation x,y and z are working and living in cities to find income and mostly leaving the old man/woman at their village. in the end leaving the lands and farms unattended (because grandpa/grandma are already old to work and care the lands).
most end up selling their land and the money the new generation get were invested in businesses, building or renovating house in the cities or in another country, etc. 
as you saw in the video, you can see herbs, clean ponds and rivers, varieties of vegetations, animals like birds, chicken, duck, are well taken care of. these are their daily source of food because there are no supermarket nearby where you can buy from there. thus, why need to buy if you can get it fresh from your own farm? chinese are particular in what they eat (diets and healthy) so they grew herbs, vegetables and live stocks. that is how the baby boomers generation survived along the years away from town or cities. 
the beautiful lady is one of the most impressive grandchild in her family. not just beautiful but also hardworking, diligent, caring and humble because she still carry on her family's tradition and the lands. she learns all sorts of cooking, fermenting, recipes could be mostly from her grandparents which is oustanding. 
i too once lived like hers until i was 19 years old and i loves everything just like hers until my grandma passed away and the land was sold by my uncle that year. 
the memories i had never perish. i still remember the smell in the morning when i'm standing in the middle of the farm, the morning dewdrops on the leaves and grasses, the sounds of birds and water flowing in the small river, the bamboo forests in the evening like golden, chasing gooses, collecting the chicken eggs, collecting the sap from rubber trees, the soothing cold wind on the pepper farm hills, catching grasshoppers among the grasses, catching fireflies at night, the smell of firewood burning while boiling hot water, the food that my grandma used to cooked, my cousin shouting from afar teasing me while plucking potatoes from the ground, etc. i misses all that when i watched the video. 
i did went back to the village a few years ago but it wasnt the same anymore and the place changed alot and the farm wasnt like it used to be like. the peaceful life that i missed.","正如我们在视频中所看到的那样，森林，农场，院子，烹饪炉和餐具的背景是真实的。过去，尤其是对于中国人民，我们祖先在拥有的每一英寸土地上都在努力工作。他们利用自然界提供的一切。几代人的一代人的土地蓬勃发展。来自婴儿潮一代时代（像奶奶一样）的最后一代可能是同类的最后一代，因为由于现代和技术/gadjets世界的变化。 X，Y和Z一代在城市工作并居住在城市中，并大部分将老人/女人留在他们的村庄里，所以并没有多少人像视频中的生活那样过上生活。最后，离开土地和农场无人看管（因为爷爷/祖母已经在工作和照顾土地上已经老了）。
大多数人最终出售了他们的土地，以及新一代获得的资金投资于企业，在城市或另一个国家建造或翻新房屋等。
正如您在视频中看到的那样，您可以看到草药，干净的池塘和河流，各种植被，鸟类，鸡肉，鸭子等动物。这些是他们的日常食物来源，因为附近没有超市可以从那里购买。因此，如果您可以从自己的农场获得新鲜，为什么还需要购买呢？中国人在吃的东西（饮食和健康）中是特别的，因此他们种植了草药，蔬菜和活蛋。这就是婴儿潮一代在远离城镇或城市的几年中生存的方式。
美丽的女士是她家庭中最令人印象深刻的孙子之一。不仅美丽，而且勤奋，勤奋，关怀和谦虚，因为她仍然具有家人的传统和土地。她了解各种烹饪，发酵，食谱可能主要来自她的祖父母，这是罢工的。
我曾经像她一样像她一样生活，直到我19岁，我都喜欢像她这样的一切，直到我的祖母去世，那一年我的叔叔出售了这片土地。
我从未灭亡的记忆。我仍然记得早晨，当我站在农场中间时，早晨的气味，叶子和草地上的碎屑，小河中鸟类和水的声音，傍晚的竹林像金色一样，追逐鸡蛋，收集鸡蛋，从橡胶树中收集树液，在胡椒农场山上舒缓的冷风，在草中捕捉蚱hoppers，在晚上捕获萤火虫，柴火的气味在沸腾的热水时燃烧，食物，我是我的食物。奶奶曾经煮过，我的堂兄从远处大喊大叫，一边从地上摘下土豆，等等。
几年前，我确实回到了村庄，但不再一样，这个地方改变了很多，农场不像以前那样。我错过的和平生活。"

when it comes to food, don't think those who are rejected only eat garbage. instead, they learned to find nutrition in the neglected meat and vegetables. they learned to clean, cut pieces, seasoned and stewed wild vegetables and meat, some household vegetables and meats ignored in the food market, and learned to use aromatic wood cigarettes (such as mountain walnuts, walnuts and bean shrubs

说到食物，不要以为那些被拒绝的人只吃垃圾。相反，他们学会了在被忽视的肉类和蔬菜中寻找营养。他们学会了清洁，切块，调味和慢炖慢炖的野菜和肉类，在食品市场上被忽略的部分家用蔬菜和肉类，并且学会了使用芳香的木烟（如山核桃，山核桃和豆科灌木

in the distant past, the world of noah's life was like such corruption today. at that time, god regretted making people (all people thought at that time were all evil), so god wiped out with the floods (only stayed in staying (only stayed in staying because of his ""fear of god""), human ancestor adam, adam, chose to accept the temptation and did not follow god. from then on, he entered the world. today, our world, enjoy the convenience brought by technology, the emergence of the internet , make the world a global village, but people's relationships have become more complicated, violent porn information, etc., constantly seduce the world to sin, we live in a world of deceit happy, no longer respect others. this lifestyle makes us more and more farther away from god. it is also unpleasant to god. many people do not know the god who creates the universe or does not want to know god, does not want to know the gospel. it is superstitious, but the bible tells us that god was the versatile god that was in the past and eternal in the past, and god hated ""sin"". no longer the same, we have lost eternal life, life is limited, and god has set a day to judge the world according to the people (jesus) set up by his (jesus). god loves the world. the only sons jesus became a flesh, nailed to ten, and the life of our sinful life with his innocent life was resurrected three days after his death. sitting on the right of god jehovah, so that we could pardon through jesus, repentance and was baptized. the holy spirit believes that jesus becomes a savior, so that we have a new style, and then live according to the inspiration of the bible. jesus said: you have a lot of love for people, and you have more forgiveness. ; what amount do you use to give you, and what amount to use will be used to give you .. similar teaching bibles are inspired. if we are willing to obey, we will have the opportunity to save.

we live in the scientific era, and people no longer believe in god, but we can't see that it does not mean nothing. the busy life makes us have no time to think. what will we face after death? since the outbreak of the new crown virus, we are becoming more and more feeling the impermanence and fragility of life, jesus told us in lujia gospel: a sinner repent, and he must also happy for him in the sky, and he is more happy than ninety -nine righteous people who do not have to repent. god loves us to be close to him. we are all created in the style of god. we must never be punished because of sin, so the last days have been extended for a long time. they are looking for those who belong to him.
the gospel of john mentioned: jesus said, ""i am the road, truth, and life, and no one can get to the father if she doesn't use me.
dear friend, jesus christ is the grace of god. god's mercy on the world allows us to receive this grace in vain without paying any cost. the choice, please study the bible (with app) to understand god's grace and jesus' teaching of sin, or go to the church to understand the gospel, (there is a fake blessing to confuse the world, we need to distinguish it) family, i wish you peace.","面对这个人心愈来愈败坏ˋ天灾人祸不断的世界,人们冲突愈来愈多,不法的事情也愈来愈多,许多人的爱心渐渐冷淡,这些世界的景况,耶稣在马太福音里就有提到:你们将听见打仗和打仗的风声，不要惊慌。这些事是必须有的，只是末期还没有到。民要攻打民，国要攻打国；多处必有地震、饥荒。这都是灾难的起头..

在遥远的过去,挪亚生活的年代世界就犹如今天这样的败坏,当时神后悔造人(那时的人所思所想尽都是恶),于是神就用大洪水灭绝所有人(只有留下挪亚因为他""敬畏神""),人类祖先亚当ˋ夏娃选择接受诱惑而不顺从上帝,从此罪就入了世界,时至今日我们的世界,享受科技带来的便利性,网路的出现,让世界成为一个地球村,但是人们的关系也变的复杂,暴力ˋ色情资讯等等,不断的在诱惑世人犯罪,我们就生活一个诡诈ˋ谎言ˋ贪婪ˋ欲望无止境的世界里,人们追求自我快乐,不再尊重其他人,这样的生活方式让我们离上帝愈来愈遥远,也是上帝不喜悦的,很多人不清楚创造宇宙的上帝或者不想了解上帝,不想知道福音,认为时代那么进步这都是迷信,但是圣经告诉我们上帝是昔在ˋ今在ˋ以后永在的全能神,并且上帝恨恶""罪"",在亚当ˋ夏娃选择不顺从神的结果,让我们因为罪和圣洁的神属性不再一样,我们也失去永生,生命受到限制,而神已经定了日子，要借着祂所设立的人(耶稣)按公义审判天下,神爱世人.上帝在二千年前差了祂的独生子耶稣道成肉身,钉上十架,以祂无罪的生命代替我们有罪的生命赎罪,死后三天复活,坐在上帝耶和华神的右边,让我们可以借着耶稣罪得赦免,悔改ˋ受洗ˋ领受圣灵ˋ相信耶稣成为救主,让我们有新生的样式,之后按照圣经的启示来生活,耶稣说:您对人付出的爱多,您的赦免就多,你们怎样论断人，也必怎样被论断；你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们..类似的教导圣经都有启示,如果我们愿意顺服,都有机会得救.

我们活在科学时代,人不再相信有神,,不过看不到不代表没有,忙碌的生活让我们没有时间思考,人死后接下要面对什么?自从新冠病毒爆发以来,我们愈来愈感到生命的无常以及脆弱,耶稣在路加福音告诉我们:一个罪人悔改，在天上也要这样为他欢喜，较比为九十九个不用悔改的义人欢喜更大。神是喜爱我们亲近祂的,我们都是按着神的样式造的,绝对不要我们因为罪而受罚,所以末后的日子延长了很久,(耶稣离开2千年了)神要世人悔改归向祂,天天都在寻找归向祂的人.
约翰福音提到:耶稣说“我就是道路、真理、生命若不借着我，没有人能到父那里。
亲爱的朋友,耶稣基督就是神的恩典,神怜悯世人让我们不用付出什么代价就可以白白的领受这个恩典,末世的征兆愈来愈显明,在有限的生命里尽快的接受福音绝对是您最好的选择,恳请您研读圣经(有app)来了解神的恩典以及耶稣对罪的教导,或是到教会了解福音,(有假福音在迷惑世人,需要明辨)让我们一同进入神国的大家庭,祝平安ˋ喜乐."
