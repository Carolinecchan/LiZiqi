after exiting this video yesterday, i immediately saw a video that introduced her rise. i went to see it.
at the beginning, it was the beginning of the food. i found her earliest video. the cooking method was skilled, the color and fragrance were great, and the splicing was relatively coherent. very normal. there are no fairy -fluttering people in the picture. it is a very normal video.
later, began to be excavated, and the consortium began to fund her and provides professional editing. at this time, the style of painting began to change and became a question i asked in the previous message.
in fact, the content she produced is more suitable for one hour.
each process of picking, finishing, and production is displayed at least five minutes, and the video content may not be so messy.
other bloggers may be divided into four or five issues, and finally together becomes an ending.
thinking above.","谢谢说明
昨天退出这个视频之后，立刻看到了一个介绍她崛起过程的视频，我去看了一下。
一开始的确是美食开始，我找了她最早期的视频，做菜手法娴熟，色香味也棒，剪接也比较连贯，不会东一个画面西一个画面。很正常。画面里面也不太出现仙气飘飘的人。是一个很正常的视频。
到了后来，开始被发掘，财团开始资助她并且提供专业的剪辑，这个时候画风开始转变，变成我上一个留言所询问的问题。
其实以她所产制的内容，比较适合一个钟的内容。
把采摘，整理，制作的每一个过程至少用五分钟展示，可能视频内容不会这么凌乱。
其他的博主可能这么多内容是分成四五期展示，最后合起来成为一个收尾。

万里长城、孔子、旗袍在历史上都是韩国的文化。 孔子出生在韩国的庆州，有韩国血统的父母，万里长城是韩国人为保护韩半岛免遭敌人袭击而建造的。 旗袍也是韩服中变形的衣服。 韩国人想打扮的时候穿韩服，睡觉的时候没有格调的场合穿旗袍。 现在可以看到中国的少数民族穿旗袍，那是借着很久之前的韩国文化维持至今的。

guys, i hope that you can see my comment. i'm here to tell you something about her childhood and now. as far as i'm concerned, her mother passed away when she was little. soon after, her father married another woman. her stepmother was mean, she was like every stepmother you've read about in the fairy tales. ziqi was forced to do all the housework, she didn't even get to go to school usually. her grandparents were very supportive to her and protected her, they are the most important people to her. her father passed away then, and idk what happened to her stepmother after that. she then quit school and came to the cities to work as much as she could to help her grandparents. she has been a waitress, a dj and all the other stuffs. but then, her granddad passed away, and her grandmother as you all see in the videos was sick. so she quit everything and came back to her hometown to take care of her grandmother although she knew that the finance would be a burden. she then figured out how to make a video. she made the video how to dye cloth by grapes' skin and people love it. she did all the work by herself and try again countless times. one video that is making chinese noodles, everytime she has set the camera angle, the dough got dry and she cannot use it anymore. so she had to make the dough by scratch again and again to record. the dough that was dry, she then baked them into bread for her and her mother to eat. she then said that she was scared just looking at the bread for a while. when she had some money earned from the videos, she hired some camera men, just 2 or 3, to support her. but the fame and popularity have led to her lack of privacy. papparazi, fly cams are all over her house, she feels really sorry and somehow guilty to her grandmother because of that. she suggested moving to another house but her grandmother told that she had lived in the house for her entire life, so she wouldn't want to move. some people may say that the videos are fake, that she didn't actually do what was shown in the videos, she just shows her hardworking hands. she really has had an unfortunate childhood, so she deserves what she has today. please, if you find my comment interesting, leave a like. this is based on my own knowledge so if i'm wrong, let me know. you can support her by clicking the ads or watching it till the end. thank you ❤","ốngkínhtâybắc订户
伙计们，希望您能看到我的评论。我在这里告诉您有关她的童年和现在的信息。就我而言，她的母亲小时候去世了。不久之后，她的父亲嫁给了另一个女人。她的继母是卑鄙的，她就像您在童话故事中读过的每个继母一样。 Ziqi被迫进行所有家务劳动，她通常甚至都没有上学。她的祖父母对她非常支持并保护她，他们是她最重要的人。她父亲那时去世了，在那之后她的继母发生了什么事。然后，她退出学校，来到城市尽可能多地工作以帮助她的祖父母。她一直是女服务员，DJ和所有其他东西。但是随后，她的爷爷去世了，当你在视频中看到的那样，她的祖母病了。因此，她辞去一切，然后回到家乡照顾祖母，尽管她知道财务将是一个负担。然后，她想出了如何制作视频。她制作了视频如何用葡萄的皮肤染色布，人们喜欢它。她自己做所有的工作，然后无数次重试。一个正在制作中国面条的视频，每次设置相机角度时，面团都会干燥，她再也无法使用它了。因此，她不得不一次又一次地划痕才能记录下来。干燥的面团，然后将它们烤成面包供她和她的母亲吃。然后，她说她只是害怕看面包一段时间。当她从视频中赚钱时，她雇用了一些只有2或3个相机的人来支持她。但是，名望和受欢迎程度导致她缺乏隐私。帕帕拉西（Papparazi），苍蝇凸轮都在她的房子上，因此，她对祖母感到非常抱歉，并以某种方式感到内gui。她建议搬到另一所房子，但她的祖母告诉她一生都住在房子里，所以她不想搬家。有些人可能会说这些视频是假的，她实际上没有做视频中显示的事情，她只是展示了勤奋的手。她确实有一个不幸的童年，所以她应该得到今天的一切。请，如果您觉得我的评论很有趣，请留下类似。这是基于我自己的知识，所以如果我错了，请告诉我。您可以通过单击广告或观看直到最后来支持她。谢谢"
