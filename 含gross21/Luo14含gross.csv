when you look at cultures that eat some rather unusual foods that for others seems ""gross"" or ""weird"" (snails, frogs, insects, etc) and they dont seemingly exist in a place where there exists a complete lack of options the question becomes ""why?"" 

i mean can you imagine the first guy who was sitting on a riverbank one day and said, either to himself or someone nearby, ""ya know what? i am gonna go eat that snail"" or the first person to say ""boy that frog looks yummy and i bet its legs would be tasty"". i should also point out that in chinese the word for frog (when you are using the term in the context of being a food, at least) basically translates into ""field chicken"". specified the context because it has other names just like most things do based on the context of the discussion.","我继续不了解各种文化及其传统食物的一件事是，它首先是如何真正开始的。

当您查看吃一些相当不寻常的食物的文化时，这些食物似乎“粗糙”或“怪异”（蜗牛，青蛙，昆虫等），它们似乎并不存在于存在完全缺乏选择的地方，问题就变成了问题。 “为什么？”

我的意思是，您能想象有一天坐在河岸上的第一个人对自己或附近的人说：“你知道吗？我要去吃那蜗牛了”或第一个说“青蛙看起来的男孩好吃，我敢打赌它的腿会很美味”。我还应该指出，在中文中，青蛙一词（至少在作为食物的背景下使用该术语时）基本上会转化为“野鸡”。指定上下文，因为它具有其他名称，就像大多数事情一样，基于讨论的上下文。"
