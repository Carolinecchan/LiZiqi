as many as 10 million dogs are believed to be killed for their meat annually in china, with up to 10,000 killed for the yulin festival, according to the washington-based humane society. while much of the meat comes through legitimate farms, many dog slaughterhouses are run privately and secretively to avoid scrutiny by food-safety inspectors.
