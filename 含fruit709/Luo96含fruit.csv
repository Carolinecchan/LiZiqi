4589,UgwvTSx2InKXqlHYop54AaABAg,1,"brazilian cuisine is the result of a mixture of european, indigenous and african ingredients. many of the components of the recipes and preparation techniques are of indigenous origin, having undergone modifications by the portuguese and slaves from africa. these made adaptations of their typical dishes replacing the missing ingredients with local correspondents. the brazilian feijoada, a typical dish of the country, is an example of this. the slaves brought to brazil since the middle of the 16th century added elements such as palm oil and couscous to national cuisine. and the waves of immigrants received by the country between the 19th and 20th centuries, coming in large numbers from europe, brought some novelties to the national menu and concomitantly strengthened the consumption of various ingredients.

daily food, made in three meals, involves the consumption of coffee with milk, bread, fruits, cakes and sweets for breakfast, beans and rice for lunch - the brazilian's basic meal, to which are sometimes added pasta , meat, salad and potatoes - and, for dinner, soups and also the various regional foods.

distilled beverages were brought by the portuguese or, like cachaça, made on the land. wine is also widely consumed, sometimes added to water and sugar, in the well-known sangria. beer in turn began to be consumed in the late 18th century and is today one of the most common alcoholic drinks.

the most visible regional cuisines belong to the states of minas gerais and bahia, with minas gerais cuisine marked by european influence in delicacies and dairy products such as tropeiro beans (also a dish from são paulo cuisine), cheese bread (which is equivalent to paraguayan chipa, differing in format) and the cheese from minas frescal, and bahian cuisine due to the presence of african delicacies such as acarajé, abará and vatapá. pernambuco's cuisine stands out for its so-called ""pernambuco sweets"", that is, the sweets developed during the colonial and imperial periods in its sugar mills such as the bolo de bolo, souza leão cake and top hat, and also for drinks and savory delicacies discovered or probably originated in the state, such as cachaça, beiju and feijoada à brasileira.","巴西美食是欧洲，土著和非洲成分混合的结果。食谱和制备技术的许多组成部分都是土著起源，对葡萄牙人进行了修改和非洲的奴隶进行了修改。这些对其典型的菜肴进行了改编，用当地的记者代替了缺失的成分。巴西Feijoada是该国典型的菜肴，就是一个例子。自16世纪中叶以来，这些奴隶带到了巴西，增加了棕榈油和国家美食等蒸粗麦的元素。该国在19至20世纪收到的移民浪潮，来自欧洲的数量很大，为国家菜单带来了一些新颖性，并加强了各种成分的消费。

每日食物，三顿饭，涉及牛奶，面包，水果，蛋糕和糖果的咖啡，午餐的豆类和米饭 - 巴西的基本餐，有时会添加意大利面，肉，沙拉，沙拉和土豆 - 而且，晚餐，汤以及各种区域性食品。

蒸馏饮料是由葡萄牙人或像Cachaça一样在土地上制成的。葡萄酒也被广泛消耗，有时在著名的桑格利亚汽酒中添加到水和糖中。反过来，啤酒在18世纪后期开始消耗掉，如今已成为最常见的酒精饮料之一。

最明显的区域美食属于Minas Gerais和Bahia的州，Minas Gerais美食在美味佳肴和乳制品（例如Tropeiro Beans）（也是Tropeiro Beans）（也是圣保罗菜的菜肴），奶酪面包（与Paraguayan相当于Paraguayan ance of Paraguayan breads of tropeiro beans and Dish菜肴）。 Chipa，格式不同）和来自Minas Frescal的奶酪，以及由于存在Acarajé，Abará和Vatapá等非洲美食而导致的Bahian Cuisine。 Pernambuco的美食以其所谓的“ Pernambuco Sweets”而脱颖而出，也就是说，在其糖厂的殖民时期和帝国时期开发的糖果，例如Bolo de Bolo，SouzaLeão蛋糕和顶级帽子，也用于饮料，饮料，咸味发现或可能起源于该州的美味佳肴，例如Cachaça，Beiju和FeijoadaàBrasileira。"

title: changli
1. family affairs, do not say to outsiders.
for example, if you talk about the economic situation at home, the place where your family usually goes out, or when the family is expected to go, in case of the thief or someone who is interested, they will break through the empty door and do bad things.
in addition, the ancients said that the family was ugly. if complains and accusing their families of listening to outsiders, others could not help you solve the problem. it would not only hurt the dignity of the family, but also made outsiders impress your family. or outsiders pass the housework you said as a gossip. if the sky is chaotic and then spread back to your ears, it will not only be unable to argue, but also increase the family's heart.

2. buddhism: knowing that more methods are actually giving.
❤ faiba: wisdom and wisdom.
i often read the ancient sage books and do their best. let the general public pay attention to moral cultivation and distinguish between right and wrong, so that they will not argue with others or sin.
❤ 富。。.
foreign wealth is something outside of the body, money, clothes, food, etc., provided to those in need.
inner wealth is his own body. at home, we help our family to do housework, serve our family with our bodies, and help the poor to help the poor disadvantage. this is all fortune. only can it be available.
❤ the fearless giving is the reason, the obtained fruit is healthy and longevity.
everything is terrifying, fearful, and threatened by life. you help him leave all horror and let him be physically and mentally stable. this is called fearless giving.

3. see the person who is lost, don't say proud.
(those who understand the feelings of others can always think about others.)
when he encounters frustrated, sad, and lost people, he has been hit in all aspects and is very unhappy. it should be said that he can comfort him, instead of saying how much he is.
when others break their fortunes and lose their jobs, you say that you are promoted to get rich, which will make the other party even more unbearable. pride and pride itself is evil, let alone hurt people?
on the contrary, the mood that can be eliminated by others' nervousness or anxiety is good. even if you ca n’t help you, do n’t go down. don't do it because of goodness, don't do it because of evil.
it is not only violence and crime called evil deeds. the evil thoughts that people often can't stop are the source of disaster.
welcome to print. bleak","弟子规（3）
❤泛爱众
凡是人。皆须爱。天同覆。
地同载。

【易解】 只要是人，就是同类，不分族群、人种、性别、宗教信仰，皆应相亲相爱。同是天地所化育覆载的，应该不分你我，互助合作，才能维持这个共生共荣的生命共同体。
❤
行高者。名自高。人所重。
非貌高。才大者。望自大。
人所服。非言大。
❤
【易解】 德行高尚者，名望自然高显，大家所敬重的是他的德行，不是外表容貌。有才能的人，处理事情的能力卓越，声望自然不凡，然而人们所欣赏佩服的，是他的处事能力，而不是因为他擅于夸耀。
❤
己有能。勿自私。人所能。
勿轻訾。勿谄富。勿骄贫。
勿厌故。勿喜新。人不闲。
勿事搅。人不安。勿话扰。

【易解】 当你有能力可以为众人服务的时候，不要自私自利，只考虑到自己，舍不得付出。对于他人的才华，应当学习、欣赏、赞叹，而不是批评、嫉妒、毁谤。不要去讨好巴结富有的人，也不要在穷人面前骄傲自大，或者轻视他们。更不可以喜新厌旧，对于老朋友或旧事物要珍惜，对于新朋友或新事物不要贪恋。当别人正在忙碌的时候，不要去打扰他，当别人心情不好或身心欠安的时候，不要闲言闲语去干扰他，增加他的烦恼与不安。
❤
人有短。切莫揭。人有私。
切莫说。道人善。即是善。
人知之。愈思勉。扬人恶。
即是恶。疾之甚。祸且作。
善相劝。德皆建。过不规。
道两亏。

【易解】 别人的缺点，不要去揭穿。别人的隐私，切忌去张扬。赞美他人的优点或善行，就是行善。当对方听到你的称赞之后，必定会更加勉励行善。张扬他人的过失或缺点，就是行恶，如果指责批评太过分了，还会给自己招来灾祸。朋友之间应该互相规过劝善，共同建立良好的品德修养。如果有错不能互相规劝，两个人的品德都会有缺陷。
❤
凡取与。贵分晓。与宜多。
取宜少。将加人。先问己。
己不欲。即速己。恩欲报。
怨欲忘。报怨短。报恩长。

【易解】 财物的取得或给予，一定要分办清楚明白，宁可多给别人，自己少拿一些，才能广结善缘，与人和睦相处。要将事物加到别人身上，或要托别人做事之前，先要反问自己：「如果换成是我，我愿意吗？」如果连自己都不愿意，就要立刻停止。受人恩惠要记得报答。别人有对不起自己的事，应该宽大为怀把它忘掉。怨恨不平的事不要记在心中太久，过去就算了。别人对我们的恩德，则要铭记在心，感恩不忘，常思报答。
❤
待婢仆。身贵端。虽贵端。
慈而宽。势服人。心不然。
理服人。方无言。

【易解】 对待家中的婢女与仆人，要注重自己的品行端正并以身作则。虽然品行端正很重要，但是仁慈宽大更可贵。如果仗势强逼别人服从，对方难免口服心不服。唯有以理服人，别人才会心悦诚服没有怨言。

同是人。类不齐。流俗众。
仁者希。果仁者。人多畏。
言不讳。色不媚。能亲仁。
无限好。德日进。过日少。
不亲仁。无限害。小人进。
百事坏。

【易解】 同样是人，善恶邪正、心智高低却是良莠不齐。受风气流俗影响的人多，仁慈宽厚的人少。如果是真正有仁德的人，大家自然敬畏他，因为他说话公正无私没有隐瞒，又不讨好他人，所以大家自然会起敬畏之心。能够亲近仁德的人，向他学习，是很幸运的事，因为他会使我们的德行一天比一天进步，过错也跟着一天天减少。如果不肯亲近仁人君子，就会有无穷的祸害，因为不肖的小人会趁虚来接近我们，日积月累，我们的言行思想都会受到不良的影响，甚至使整个人生走入错误的方向。


不力行。但学文。长浮华。
成何人。但力行。不学文。
任己见。昧理真。

【易解】 不能身体力行孝、悌、谨、信、泛爱众、亲仁这些本分，一味死读书，纵然有些知识，也只是增长自己浮华不实的习气，变成一个不切实际的人，如此读书又有何用？如果只是谨守教诲，却不肯读书学习，就容易因不明事理，而依自己的偏见行事，造成错误而不自知，这也是不对的。

读书法。有三到。心眼口。
信皆要。方读此。勿慕彼。
此未终。彼勿起。宽为限。
紧用功。工夫到。滞塞通。
心有疑。随札记。就人问。
求确义。

【易解】 读书的方法要注重三到：眼到、口到、心到，三者缺一不可，如此方能收到事半功倍的效果。研究学问要专一、专精才能深入，不能这本书才开始读没多久，又欣羡其他的书，想看其他的书，这样永远也定不下心把一本书好好深入读通。必须把这本书读完，才能再读另外一本。在订定读书计画的时候，不妨宽松一些，实际执行时，就要加紧用功，严格执行，不可以懈怠偷懒。日积月累功夫深了，原先窒碍不通、困顿疑惑之处，自然而然都迎刃而解了。求学当中，心里有疑问时，应随时笔记，一有机会，就向良师益友请教，务必确实明白它的真义。

房室清。墙壁净。几案洁。
笔砚正。墨磨偏。心不端。
字不敬。心先病。列典籍。
有定处。读看毕。还原处。
虽有急。卷束齐。有缺坏。
就补之。非圣书。屏勿视。
蔽聪明。坏心志。勿自暴。
勿自弃。圣与贤。可驯致。

【易解】 书房要整理清洁，墙壁要保持干净。读书时，书桌上笔墨纸砚等文具要摆放整齐不凌乱，触目所及皆是井然有条，才能静下心来读书。古人写字使用毛笔先要磨墨，如果心不在焉，墨就会磨偏了。写出来的字如果歪歪斜斜，就表示你浮躁不安，心定不下来。书本应该分门别类，排列整齐，放在固定的位置，阅读完毕须归还原处。虽有急事要离开，也要把书本收好再离开。书本是智慧的结晶，有缺损就要修补，保持完整。不是传述圣贤言行的著作，以及有害身心健康的不良书刊，都应该摒弃不看，以免身心受到污染、智慧遭受蒙蔽、心志变得不健康。遇到困难或挫折的时候，不要自暴自弃，也不必愤世嫉俗、怨天尤人，应该发愤向上努力学习。圣贤境界虽高，循序渐进，也是可以达到的。 ❤

弟子规易解（终）
书名：弟子规 三字经 
孝经 易解。欢迎翻印。
❤明伦教孝
读书千遍。其意自现。
落实生活。确实做到。

弟子规原名＜训蒙文＞，为清朝康熙年间秀才李毓秀所作。其内容采用《论语》学而篇第六条：「弟子入则孝，出则弟，谨而信，泛爱众，而亲仁，行有余力，则以学文。」的文义以三字一句，两句一韵编纂而成，分为五个部份加以演述；具体列举出为人子弟在家、出外、待人接物、求学应有的礼仪与规范，特别讲求家庭教育与生活教育。后经清朝贾存仁修订改编，并改名为＜弟子规＞，是启蒙养正，教育子弟敦伦尽份防邪存诚，养成忠厚家风的最佳读物。
书名：常礼举要
1.家庭之事，不可向外人言。
举例来说，如果你讲到家里的经济状况、家人平常出入的地点，或是什么时间家人预计要去哪里，万一被小偷或是有心人士打听到了，他们会闯空门、做坏事。
另外，古人说家丑不可外扬，若是抱怨、指责家人给外人听，别人也不能帮你解决问题，不仅会伤害家人的尊严，也让让外人对你们一家印象不佳。又或者外人把你说的家务事都当成闲谈八卦传出去，若是说得天花乱坠再传回你耳中，不仅百口莫辩，也徒增一家人心里难受。

2.佛教：知道得到更多的方法其实是布施。
❤法布施：得聪明智慧。
常常读古圣贤书，并身体力行。让社会大众能够注重品德修养，能够分辨是非，才不会与人争执或是犯罪。
❤财布施得财富、功德。
外财就是身外之物，钱、衣服、食物等，提供给需要的人。
内财是自己身体。我们在家里面，帮助家人做家事，用我们的身体为家人服务，在外做义工帮助贫困弱势这都是财布施。能舍才有得。
❤无畏布施是因，得到的果报是健康长寿。
万物有恐怖、有畏惧、生命受到威胁，你帮助他离开一切恐怖，让他身心安稳，这叫无畏布施。

3.见失意人，不说得意语。
（明白别人感受的人总是能够多为别人着想呢。）
遇到失意、伤心、失落的人，他各方面都受到打击，很不得意，应该说点让他得到安慰的话，而不是说自己有多在行、多厉害。
当别人破了财，丢了工作，你却说自己升官发财，这会让对方更加不堪忍受。傲慢、骄傲本身即是恶，更何况用来伤人？
相反的，能够免除别人紧张恐惧或是忧虑的心情即是善，即便帮不上忙也千万不要落井下石。勿因善小而不为，勿因恶小而为之。
并非只有暴力、犯罪才叫恶行，人常常止不住的恶念也是灾难的源头。
