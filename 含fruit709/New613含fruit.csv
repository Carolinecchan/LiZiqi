i spent the strength of nine niu and tiger to make a video. so far, i only have 160 subscriptions, and the best video is watching more than 1,000 people.

i know li ziyi's weight. everyone also weighs.

everyone has the most discussions. the most misunderstanding of li ziyi is that she is just an actor, and her work is made by a huge team.

please understand her development history a little.

li ziyi had a childhood young man who had been unable to look back, had various workers, and had a long period of time for a person's exploration of experiments. he finally rely on his talents, hard work, hard work, and succeed.

the current situation, i am afraid that zhang yimou is likely to be a director. of course, li ziyi does not need zhang yimou. i have an analogy. li ziyi has no self -learning talent, and the artistic talent shown is no worse than zhang yimou.

li ziyi rely on his own efforts to come to this day. you open your eyes and talk nonsense, and you are unwilling to do basic investigations and research. he maliciously pour dirty girls to a hard -working girl.

really blushing for you. be kind. do nโ€t be so rude and hateful.

true: li ziyi's true, not that she is too beautiful, not what kind of shoes are wearing in the farmland. in my eyes, li zizhen's true, manifested in her hard work, hard work, and manifested in her soul. nothing will do.

of course, she will not seriously and deliberately express the hardships of the peasants in sichuan and the sufferings of rural poor today. li ziyi is pursuing the amount of subscriptions and click volume. her performance is basically impeccable.

li ziyi truly shows her own pursuit of life and her own state of life.

of course, try your best to beautify. otherwise, where can i subscribe?

good: see her depending on the grandmother's life, and take care of each other. thinking that grandma finally got a good life, she was really happy.

thinking of my work hard for a whole life. li ziyi's kindness is one of the biggest highlights of the video.

beauty: needless to say. i admire me and admire from the bottom of my heart. some people will say, team teams, foreign announcements and so on.

you just need to see li ziyi's earliest video to feel her artistic talent.

besides: with the current situation of li ziyi's current daily gold, let alone the government, any of the people with funds will not hesitate to make a behind -the -scenes team.

dawai xuan:

where is this? what big publicity? what a crime is to have no words. a girl mixed with meals, accidentally red and purple, do nโ€t tm โ€s blind eyes?

but here to tell the government and the communist youth league, do not speculate. stir good things. what is the blind ginseng?

the government was not stupid, and i saw li ziyi's success and wanted to use it. in fact, maybe good intentions have become bad things. with my concept, the government, the communist youth league, the best leave her alone. it is not as good as the last four, truth, goodness and beauty.

ziyi, please be careful. no need to cooperate too deeply with the government. tell them to let you develop freely in accordance with their greatest interests. otherwise, the end may not be good for anyone.

cut!

during the seven years of labor in rural areas during the revolution, the hardships of the rural areas of china's rural areas know a little.

the reason why li ziyi feels is because most of the farm work that li ziyi has done has done it, and i will even accept the soles of the shoe. i rushed the cow to rake the ground in the paddy field, and i tried it. if you can't try it, you have to give it to the poor farmers around him. very difficult work. i did not dry the back of the mountain from the mountain. there are no bamboo or mountains there. almost all of the others can't be familiar. rice, wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, pigs and sheep beef, planting vegetables. we do not plant fruit trees. moving the bricks by myself and moving the bricks. at the age of seventeen, he was cooking for fifteen students.

li ziyi used bamboo to make a sofa for me too much. too admire!

ziyi, refueling ๅฟ…๏ธ do not worry about it. take your own way and let others have a way. don't ignore some people's words of talking nonsense.

ps

ziyi does not necessarily know the history of 12 million people starved in sichuan during the great famine. mianyang is the hardest hit area. please know. it is important to your future development.","最近李子柒担任“中国农村青年致富带头人推广大使”，引发新一轮评论热潮。看了一些，忍俊不禁，有感而发，希望能够提供不同视角。

关键是，希望大家平心静气，就事论事，尽量做到兼听则明。

不要语言欺凌一个勤劳勇敢聪慧的女孩子。

按照逮着老鼠就是好猫的说法，李子柒不啻是一只杰出的极其优秀的好猫。不说人民币收入，她大把大把的在国际舞台上赚美元，大概每天几万美元吧，羡煞众人，实现自己养家糊口侍奉奶奶的人生梦想，获得原本不敢奢望的收获，可喜可贺令人钦佩。

将近800万外国粉丝，大家是冲着视频展现的真善美来的。不服气？你试试就知道了。海外最红的自媒体华人江峰，28万订阅，已经是很多人崇拜的榜样。仅仅是这小姑娘的3%。

海外牛人郭文贵每次的视频也只是几万人看。李子柒的视频动辄五六百万。最好的3千万。三年前的视频还在被人每天搜索，点击量继续暴涨。

这可不是一般的奇迹。

我费了九牛二虎之力做视频，至今只有160订阅量，最好的一个视频1000多人观看。

我知道李子柒的分量。大家也掂量掂量。

大家议论最多，对李子柒误解最大的是，她不过是个演员，工作都是一个庞大的团队做的。

请稍微了解一下她的发展史。

李子柒有过不堪回首的童年少年，有过各种打工经验，有过很长时间一个人摸索实验失败，最后靠自己的才华，勤奋，努力，获得了成功。

现在状况，恐怕邀请张艺谋来做导演都有可能。当然李子柒不需要张艺谋我是打个比方。李子柒无师自通自学成才，表现出来的艺术天分，不比张艺谋差一丝一毫。

李子柒完全靠自己的努力走到今天。你们睁着眼睛瞎说八道，连基本的调查研究都不愿意做，恶意向一个勤劳致富的女孩子泼脏水。

真替你们脸红。Be kind. Don’t be so rude and hateful.

真：李子柒的真，不是表现在她穿着过于漂亮，不是表演在穿着什么样的鞋子在农田里劳作。在我的目光里，李子柒的真，表现在她的勤劳，吃苦耐劳，表现在她的心灵手巧。啥都会干。

她当然不会去认真刻意的表现四川绵阳农民的辛苦和今日农村贫困人群的苦难。李子柒追求的是订阅量，点击量。她的表现基本无懈可击。

李子柒真实的表现了她自己对生活的追求，她自己的生活状态。

当然要尽力美化。不然哪里来订阅量？

善：看她和奶奶相依为命，互相关照。想到奶奶终于过上好日子真为子柒高兴。

想起自己姥姥勤劳一生。李子柒的善良，是视频最大亮点之一。

美：毋庸赘言。令我感佩，从心底里佩服。有人又会说了，团队团队，大外宣等等。

你只需要去看看李子柒最早的视频就能感觉到她的艺术天分。

再说一遍：以李子柒目前日进斗金的状况，别说政府，任何一个有资金的人都会毫不犹豫甘作幕后团队。

大外宣：

这哪儿跟哪儿啊？什么大外宣？真是欲加之罪 何患无辞。一个女孩子混口饭吃，不小心大红大紫，别TM的瞎着眼胡说八道好不好？

但是此处敬告政府和共青团，别投机不成舍把米。把好事搅合了。瞎参和什么呢？

政府不傻，看到李子柒的成功趁机想利用起来。其实也许好心办成坏事儿。以我的观念，政府啊共青团啊什么的最好leave her alone. 免得最后四不像，真善美不在。

子柒也请慎重。不必和政府合作太深。告诉他们让你自由发展符合他们的最大利益。不然最后也许结局对谁都不好。

切切！

在下文革时期在农村劳动七年多，对中国农村的苦难农民的艰辛略知一二。

之所以感觉李子柒的真实，就是因为李子柒干过的农活儿大部分我都干过，我甚至会纳鞋底。赶着牛在水田里耙地，我试过。怎么试都不行只好交给身边的贫农代表。很不容易的活计。从山上砍竹子背下山没有干过。我们那里没有竹子也没有山。其它几乎都再熟悉不过。水稻，小麦，玉米，红薯，养猪羊牛，种菜。我们没有种水果树。自己盖房子搬砖头用手推车运转头。十七岁当炊事员专职为十五个同学做饭。

李子柒用竹子做沙发让我太佩服了。太佩服！

子柒，加油

PS

子柒不一定知道大饥荒时期四川饿死1200万人的历史。绵阳是重灾区。请一定了解一下。对你今后发展至关重要。"

there's a huge team of ppl who make all these snacks and grow the vegetables and fruits for her. which she never mentions in her video.
she makes everyone think this is the life that you can have in the countryside, when the truth is, your probably gonna need 20 slaves if you want the life in the video.(or if your rich enough to afford 20 servants)
anyways, it's the very common way of getting famous on the internet, by making fake videos. she's fooling everyone but hardly anyone can see it. 
hands down to the 28k dislikers","我不喜欢这个视频:)
有一支庞大的PPL团队，为她制作所有这些小吃，并为她种植蔬菜和水果。她从未在视频中提到过。
她让每个人都认为这是您在乡村拥有的生活，当真相是，如果您想要视频中的生活，您可能需要20个奴隶。
无论如何，这是通过制作虚假视频在互联网上闻名的非常普遍的方式。她在欺骗所有人，但几乎没有人看到它。
