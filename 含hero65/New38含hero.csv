let's understand the culture that began in the country on the mainland when there was a country in china and the culture that started in china.
in summary, it can be said that it is the top 10 civilizations of the mainland.
that is the plague (pest), foot binding, burning books, confucianism, mao zedong, cultural revolution, tiananmen revolution, sars (sars), huangsha, wuhan pneumonia (covid-19), fake imitation row.

the four major inventions advocated by modern china or most of the culture of china called the originator of their originator are false, or the culture of other countries, and advocate that china is the originator.
regardless of the past mainland countries and modern china, people's minds are empty.
in particular, the recent chinese people have been cross -wisdom by the communist party, and they have lost their wisdom of independent judgment.
therefore, they really believe that the communist party's false institutional is shouting the communist party every day, and china is the world's highest country.
the chinese who lived with the slavery of the communist party felt very desolate.
however, there is no need to feel pitiful or regretful, because the chinese are very happy because they do not realize their own situation.
so outsiders have no reason to destroy their happiness.

there are very few chinese people who know the heroes of chinese heroes mao zedong, and even those who know they dare not say.

mao zedong is a lascivious. he especially likes a 10 -year -old girl who is not adults and women.
it is said that the older women knew too much about the world and said that there was no innocence.
moreover, it is said that a woman who likes to have husbands, especially the low education level with low education level.
when he was in his 70s, in the local guidance, there was a husband who was in his early 20s. after asking the name, mao zedong wrote his name on the manual. dongxing encouraged the husband of the husband to divorce and dedicated it to mao zedong.
it is said that he and a husband who had a husband gave birth to a few illegitimate children.

mao zedong's sexual desire is very strong, and he is basic to his wife. he has a sexually transmitted disease and melamine disease.
therefore, women who have sex with mao zedong have this disease.
but those women were proud of the disease.
at that time, mao zedong, who was worshiped in china at the same time as the living god, was in the same bed, which was a very proud thing in itself.
instead, the facts of being infected with mao zedong's sexually transmitted diseases are used as a medal. this phenomenon can be said to be crazy.

mao zedong has never washed his genitals in his life.
once, his attending doctor li zhisui mentioned health issues. mao zedong said: ""i have been bathing in a woman's body, so it doesn't matter.""
not only that, the body itself did not clean it, and the river people wiped them with a wet towel.

mao zedong's tooth health is really bad, there is no brushing, and a bit of bitter tea from chinese tea often instead of brushing your teeth with bitter tea. a lot of.

@cannot be managed by this image to manage their own leaders, the chaotic leaders in private life, and the chinese brain of the chinese who regard the people who regard the people as a hero.
the chinese do have serious mental illness.
they should be locked in mainland china and should not let them come to the world to pollute the earth.
china is a malignant tumor of the earth, and the chinese are cancer cells that torture the earth.
therefore, in order to prevent the earth's disaster, all the chinese must be located in mainland china.","@亚洲大陆东部的国家(现在中国)10大文明。
让我们来了解一下大陆上存在中国以前的国家时开始的文化和现在始于中国的文化。
综合起来，可以说是大陆起源的10大文明。
那个是鼠疫(PEST)、缠足、 焚书坑儒、毛泽东、文化大革命、天安门革命、非典(SARS)、黄沙、武汉肺炎(COVID-19)、假货模仿排场。

现代中国主张的4大发明品或中国称其鼻祖的大部分文化是假的，或者偷窃其他国家的文化，主张中国是鼻祖。
无论是过去的大陆国家，还是现代的中国，人们的头脑都是空空的。
特别是最近的中国人被共产党所弩化，丧失了自主判断的智慧。
因此，他们真的相信共产党的虚假煽动，天天喊着共产党万岁，中国是世界最高的国家。
以这种共产党的奴隶生活的中国人感到非常凄凉。
但是，没有必要对此感到可怜或惋惜，这是因为中国人没有意识到自己的这种处境而感到非常幸福。
所以外人没有理由破坏他们的幸福。

@了解中国人英雄毛泽东现实的中国人很少，即使是知道的人也不敢说出口。

毛泽东是个好色之徒，特别喜欢不是成人女性的10多岁少女。
据说，上了年纪的女子们对世事过于了解，而且说没有纯真的味道。
而且据说喜欢有夫之妇，特别是喜欢教育水平较低的纯朴的农村妇女。
70多岁的时候，在当地指导时，有一个20岁出头的有夫之妇，毛泽东在问完名字后，在手册上写上自己的名字，非常喜欢，看到此情此景的心腹汪东兴怂恿有夫之妇的丈夫离婚，并献给了毛泽东。
据说他和有夫之妇生下了几个私生子。

毛泽东性欲很旺盛，对妻子不伦不类是基本，患有一种性病，三聚氰胺的疾病。
因此，与毛泽东发生性关系的女人都得了这种病。
但是那些女人反而为得了那个病而自豪。
当时与中国崇拜得如同活生生的神一样的毛泽东同床共枕，这本身就是一件非常值得骄傲的事情。
反而把一起感染毛泽东性病的事实当作一种勋章，这种现象可以说是疯了。

毛泽东一辈子都没有亲手洗过自己的生殖器。
有一次，他的主治医生李志绥提到卫生问题，毛泽东说:""一直在女人的体内洗澡，所以没关系。"" 
不仅如此，身体本身也没有洗干净，河人们用湿毛巾擦身。

毛泽东的牙齿健康确实很糟糕，没有刷牙，而且经常喝中国茶的一种苦茶，用苦茶代替刷牙，所以牙齿健康非常不好，牙石和食物残渣很多，牙龈都积满了脓，蛀牙也很多。

@不能用这种形象管理自己的领导人、私生活混乱的领导人、把百姓视为自己玩物力的领导人视为英雄的中国人的大脑，不能不说是研究对象。
中国人确实患有严重的精神病。
应该把他们关在中国大陆，不应该让他们来到世界污染地球。
中国是地球的恶性肿瘤，中国人是折磨地球的癌细胞。
因此，要想阻止地球发生大灾难，必须将中国人全部关到死为止中国大陆内。"
