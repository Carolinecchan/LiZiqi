while the word nature in the soul transmits the impression of stability and non -change, man appears in general, and the contemporary person in particular, a historical and variable being, his changes are accelerated in our time. is it possible to say that a person is unique to the rest of the neighborhoods that he has no nature, or that every perception of human nature is a historical perception, which condemns his time more than what is supposed to be our mountain or our fixed formation? and when we look around us, we see that our partners in life, including animals and plants, seem programmers on the same deeds and interactions throughout their lives, unlike us. singer does not have a date, it does the same things every year in a cycle ... normal. senjab has a nature, although we do not know what is going on in the head of the squirrel, and what does the neighborhood mean that the neighborhood is a bond. man has a history in return, and it seems that we have a history because we have no nature.

but it seems that a person has no clear nature. we are distributed over two sexes, and we multiply with reproduction, and the young people are breastfed by mothers milk, and we need us in general and more so that we can walk, we walk on legs like birds but we do not fly like them, and if you did not sleep in an accident or kill each other for each other, we die a ""natural"" death of old age, it is rare for one or one of us to live a century. but we speak after two or three years, alone about other animals in the language. despite the multiplicity of our languages, it is not among us who are without a language, and the speaker of any language can multiply by intermarriage from the speaker of any other language, which means that we are similar biological, that is, we have one ""nature"". this is important against the ""racists"" of human beings. they deny the natural unity of humans, that is, the unity of the human element, but rather decide the large number of human elements and their salary as fixed, or natural data. in fact, the concept of nature that can be based on refuting racist claims can also be reassured to defend them.

moreover, a person is a product of a development of a life on the planet of about four billion years old, which means that the potential distinction of his nature is one of the possibilities of this life, through the process of ""natural election"" in which the best and the most able to inherit its preferences win, and it comes out of the weakest race. with these images, what seems to be out of nature is the same as natural data.

2
it seems that our current formation is fixed for hundreds of thousands of years and more, and that we have passed millions of years ago with stages during which our stature erected and our skulls expanded, and we took a symbol and made tools.

for thousands of years our history seems to be the history of what we do and create, not a natural development history, such as our development in the times of the foot. is this a short separation, which leads us to something after it? after thousands or tens of thousands of years, is it possible that our capabilities are being seen today, based on language and thought, as natural evolutionary features, which led to widespread destruction of the planet, and perhaps to delete the being who possessed these features and restore the planet and life on them? we will have a possibility of nature, destroying himself according to what might be called the natural principle of cunning. this does not seem completely excluded. it may not happen by the action of the nuclear bomb, but rather the genetic bomb, interference in the human genetic record, that is, in the ""nature"" of man in a way that produces different natures or ""elements"", the difference between us is close to us and chimpanzees, for example, and mating and reproduction may refrain from arrival to this threshold. in other words, the true racism in front of us, whether by manufacturing human beings, may not be rebellious or protected, slaves in their nature, as if they are useful pets, which are beneficial to them that they speak and reason; or through the production of superheroes who use us, we are ordinary, as slaves to them, and they see them crowding out for them on the planet and there is nothing wrong with killing hundreds of millions or billions of us, and perhaps in this they are armed with force and capabilities that we do not kiss to confront them.

3
this brings us back to the question about the human nature: what is the nature of the living being who seems able to change its nature? does the concept of nature remain good when it seems that it does not refrain from changing it, who are supposed to change it? to make new natures for themselves or others? when the organism has natures instead of one nature? or when it is possible that it is distinguished for organisms, each of which is its nature? the change of man to the ""mind"" of the language of the language (speaking with others, and the soul, from the world), and as a social evolutionary production. this ability has evolved historically, and just a few centuries ago, it presented itself the possibility of ""sovereignty"" on the nature and ""ownership"". ""sovereign"" progress has been achieved at specific levels, but its price was exorbitant as it was presented: the extinction of many neighborhood partners for us, the heating of the planet, and the threat of life on it, as well as the severe forms of discrimination between the human beings themselves, including extension of the indigenous population in two continents by the european controlles. and among them is an intercontinental commercial slavery, which blacks suffered more than others. this is at a time when perceptions such as man, his rights and humanity were heard more than ever.

is it possible that we are wondering today about the nature of man because we are touching something unnatural in ourselves, threatening the nature from which we descend?

what is this abnormal thing? perhaps a special ability for our brain and nervous system, is evolutionary (expanding the skull and the erection of the list) and socially (through language and a broader groups) on the rationality and obstruction of other beings, and ""arrest"" - they, including some people or many of them or more, are what we call the mind . man is a ""speaking animal"" in the sense of sane. perhaps the social person invented or developed cultures and religions as a matter of ""mind"" himself in particular, and from them in particular his developing nervous system anxious. the social person has produced these beliefs and rules, or ""culture"", in order to be an external mind that controls his inner, extremely internal mind, giving him customs and traditions, repetitive paths that help him have a continent's nature, or compensate him for the loss of his animal. a form of a ""detainee"" of this abnormal, natural object.","1
尽管灵魂中的大自然一词传递了稳定和不变的印象，但人类总体而言，尤其是当代人，一个历史和变量，他的变化在我们时代加速了。是否可以说，一个人是其余社区独有的，他没有天性，或者对人性的每一种看法都是一种历史感，这谴责了他的时间，而不是应该是我们的山上或我们的固定的时间编队？当我们环顾四周时，我们会看到生活中的伴侣，包括动物和植物，看上去像我们一生都在相同的行为和互动上的程序员，与我们不同。歌手没有约会，它每年在周期中做同样的事情……正常。 Senjab具有性质，尽管我们不知道松鼠的负责人正在发生什么，而该社区意味着该社区是一种纽带。人有回报的历史，而且似乎我们有历史，因为我们没有天性。

但是看来一个人没有明确的本性。我们分布在两个性别上，我们会随繁殖而繁殖，年轻人被母亲牛奶母乳喂养，我们通常需要我们，以便我们可以走路，我们可以像鸟一样走路，但我们不会像它们那样飞翔，如果您不在事故中睡觉或彼此杀死，我们将死于老年人的“自然”死亡，我们中的一个或一个世纪很少生活。但是我们在两三年之后讲话，独自一人谈论其他语言的动物。尽管我们的语言有多种多样，但我们中没有任何语言，任何语言的说话者都可以通过任何其他语言的说话者过婚，这意味着我们是相似的生物学，也就是说，我们有一种“自然”。这对人类的“种族主义者”很重要。他们否认人类的自然统一，即人的元素的统一，而是将大量人类因素及其工资确定为固定或自然数据。实际上，也可以放心可以基于反驳种族主义主张的自然概念来捍卫它们。

此外，一个人是大约40亿年历史的地球上生命发展的产物，这意味着他的本性的潜在区别是通过“自然选举”的过程之一最好和最能够继承其偏好的能力，这是最弱的种族。有了这些图像，似乎出于自然的图像与自然数据相同。

2
似乎我们目前的形成固定了数十万年以上，并且我们已经通过了数百万年前的阶段，在此期间，我们的身材竖立了，我们的头骨扩大了，我们采用了符号并制造了工具。

数千年来，我们的历史似乎是我们所做和创造的历史，而不是自然发展历史，例如我们脚时代的发展。这是一个短暂的分离，这使我们陷入了困境吗？经过数千年或数十千年的历史，今天，我们的能力可能是基于语言和思想，作为自然进化特征，这导致了地球的广泛破坏，也许是删除拥有这些特征的存在的人并恢复地球和生命吗？我们将有大自然的可能性，根据所谓的狡猾的自然原则摧毁自己。这似乎并没有完全排除。它可能不是通过核弹的作用而发生的，而是遗传炸弹的干预，即人类遗传记录，即人的“自然”，以产生不同的本质或“元素”，这之间的差异例如，我们与我们接近，黑猩猩，交配和繁殖可能避免到达这个门槛。换句话说，我们面前的真正种族主义，无论是通过制造人类而不是叛逆或受到保护的奴隶，就好像它们是有用的宠物一样，对他们说话和理性有益的宠物；或通过使用我们的超级英雄的生产，我们是普通的，是他们的奴隶，他们看到他们在地球上为他们拥挤，杀死我们数亿或数十亿或数十亿美元，也许在这方面没有错武装的力量和能力我们不会亲吻与他们面对。

3
这使我们回到了关于人本性的问题：似乎能够改变其性质的生物的本质是什么？自然的概念似乎不避免改变它，谁应该改变它？为自己或他人创造新的本性？当有机体具有天性而不是一种性质时？或者，当它有可能以生物为特色时，每种都是它的本质？人的语言（与他人，灵魂，来自世界）的语言的“思想”和社会进化论的变化。这种能力从历史上发展了，就在几个世纪前，它表明了对性质和“所有权”的“主权”的可能性。 “主权”在特定层面取得了进步，但其价格却高昂：许多邻里合作伙伴的灭绝，地球的供暖以及生命的威胁以及严重的形式人类本身之间的歧视，包括欧洲控制局在两个大陆上扩大土著人口。其中是洲际商业奴隶制，黑人比其他人遭受的苦难更大。在这个时候，诸如人类，他的权利和人性之类的观念比以往任何时候都更加听到。

今天，我们有可能想知道人的本性，因为我们在自己触摸了自己的不自然事物，威胁到我们下降的本性？

这是什么异常的事情？对于我们的大脑和神经系统来说，也许是一种特殊的能力，它是进化（扩大头骨和清单的架设）以及在社会上（通过语言和更广泛的群体）在其他生物的理性和妨碍方面（通过语言和更广泛的群体），以及“逮捕”包括某些人或许多人或更多人或更多人是我们所说的思想。从理智的意义上讲，人是一种“说话的动物”。也许社会人士特别是“思想”本人，特别是从他们发明或发展的文化和宗教，尤其是从他们发展的神经系统焦虑中。社会人士制定了这些信念和规则或“文化”，以成为一个外部思想，可以控制他内在的，极其内在的思想，给他习俗和传统，重复的道路，可以帮助他拥有大陆的本性或补偿他因为失去了动物。这种异常自然物体的“拘留者”形式。"
