36000,UgyhyXflybsr2hUCb_B4AaABAg.8uYsqKM0ju78ujHKECo9NE,33,4 years ago,"โ€ @bellabana โ€ bellabana no, it's more a culture thing. in some countries, they don't feed pets pet food, they feed them with whatever they're eating, i.e, human food. so pets get used to the smell & whenever they smell human cooking, they think it's meal time. they might beg for food but that doesn't mean they're hungry. my family used to have pet cats, they're just like that. we could be just feeding them two full plates, they'd still come & meow at our dinner table. 

our cats eat everything, rice, broccoli, tomato, lettuce... besides meat. you wonder why, huh? because that's what they grew up eating, and that's what they know as food. as long as it's food to them, they'd follow, even if they're fed. if you own pets, you would know about this. 

my neighborhood doesn't raise our pets like in the west, where owners usually lock them indoor all the time. we let them roam around freely. they all go around begging for food when neighbors are cooking. as a result, we all know about others' pets, and we are fine with them. people don't always feed them, so they know they have to come home for a proper meal, but they'd get a piece here & there, so it's like snacks for them. 

every once a while a neighborhood auntie would come up to my mom, beaming, and said, hey your cat just frequented me yesterday! ... oh do you hear him? he's frequenting someone else now...! my mom be like, yeah... guess my cooking is his least favored... the auntie be like, that's not true! pets are like that, they go around for food but they know they can always have it back home.... and then they both laugh it off.... 

this is just a different culture of doing things, it's not necessarily bad or cruel just because it's different from your way of doing it. calling ppl out without knowing their background is judgmental, and kinda condescending, you know, not nice. so yeah....","@bellabana bellabana不，这更多是一种文化。在某些国家，他们不喂宠物宠物食品，而是用他们吃的任何东西，即人类食品喂食。因此，宠物习惯了气味，每当闻到人类烹饪的气味时，他们都会认为这是用餐时间。他们可能乞求食物，但这并不意味着他们饿了。我的家人曾经有宠物猫，他们就是这样。我们可能只是在给他们喂两个完整的盘子，他们仍然会在我们的餐桌旁来和喵。

我们的猫吃了所有东西，米饭，西兰花，番茄，生菜...除了肉。你想知道为什么，是吗？因为那是他们长大的饮食，这就是他们所知道的食物。只要对他们来说食物，即使他们被喂食，他们也会遵循。如果您拥有宠物，您会知道这一点。

我的邻居不会像西方那样养宠物，那里的业主通常一直在室内锁定它们。我们让他们自由地漫游。当邻居在做饭时，他们都四处乞求食物。结果，我们都知道别人的宠物，我们对它们很好。人们并不总是喂他们，所以他们知道他们必须回家做适当的饭菜，但是他们在这里和那里都会得到一块，所以这就像小吃一样。

每隔一段时间，一个附近的阿姨会来找我妈妈，笑着说，嘿，你的猫昨天只是经常光顾我！ ...哦，你听到他的声音吗？他现在正经常去别人...！我妈妈就像，是的...猜猜我的烹饪是他最不喜欢的……阿姨就像，那不是真的！宠物就是这样，他们四处寻找食物，但他们知道他们总是可以把它放回家。...然后他们俩都笑了...。

这只是做事的一种不同的文化，不一定是坏事或残酷的，因为它与您的方式不同。在不知道自己的背景的情况下召集PPL是有判断力的，有点屈服，您知道，不好。嗯是的...."

the point is, i hope that everyone is calm, discuss things, and try to listen to it as much as possible.

don't bully a diligent, brave and intelligent girl.

according to the good cat catching the mouse, li ziyi is not an outstanding good cat. not to mention the renminbi income, she made a lot of money on the international stage, about tens of thousands of dollars a day, envy everyone, realize her dream of serving her grandmother's life, and obtaining the harvest of no dare to expect. impressive.

nearly 8 million foreign fans, everyone shows the truth, kindness showing the video. unconvinced? if you try it, you will know. jiang feng, the most popular self -media chinese, has subscribed for 280,000, is already an example for many people. it's just 3%of this little girl.

the videos of overseas cattle guo wengui are only watched tens of thousands of people every time. li ziyi's video is five or six million. the best 30 million. the video three years ago was searched every day, and the number of clicks continued to skyrocket.

this is not a general miracle.

i spent the strength of nine niu and tiger to make a video. so far, i only have 160 subscriptions, and the best video is watching more than 1,000 people.

i know li ziyi's weight. everyone also weighs.

everyone has the most discussions. the most misunderstanding of li ziyi is that she is just an actor, and her work is made by a huge team.

please understand her development history a little.

li ziyi had a childhood young man who had been unable to look back, had various workers, and had a long period of time for a person's exploration of experiments. he finally rely on his talents, hard work, hard work, and succeed.

the current situation, i am afraid that zhang yimou is likely to be a director. of course, li ziyi does not need zhang yimou. i have an analogy. li ziyi has no self -learning talent, and the artistic talent shown is no worse than zhang yimou.

li ziyi rely on his own efforts to come to this day. you open your eyes and talk nonsense, and you are unwilling to do basic investigations and research. he maliciously pour dirty girls to a hard -working girl.

really blushing for you. be kind. do nโ€t be so rude and hateful.

true: li ziyi's true, not that she is too beautiful, not what kind of shoes are wearing in the farmland. in my eyes, li zizhen's true, manifested in her hard work, hard work, and manifested in her soul. nothing will do.

of course, she will not seriously and deliberately express the hardships of the peasants in sichuan and the sufferings of rural poor today. li ziyi is pursuing the amount of subscriptions and click volume. her performance is basically impeccable.

li ziyi truly shows her own pursuit of life and her own state of life.

of course, try your best to beautify. otherwise, where can i subscribe?

good: see her depending on the grandmother's life, and take care of each other. thinking that grandma finally got a good life, she was really happy.

thinking of my work hard for a whole life. li ziyi's kindness is one of the biggest highlights of the video.

beauty: needless to say. i admire me and admire from the bottom of my heart. some people will say, team teams, foreign announcements and so on.

you just need to see li ziyi's earliest video to feel her artistic talent.

besides: with the current situation of li ziyi's current daily gold, let alone the government, any of the people with funds will not hesitate to make a behind -the -scenes team.

dawai xuan:

where is this? what big publicity? what a crime is to have no words. a girl mixed with meals, accidentally red and purple, do nโ€t tm โ€s blind eyes?

but here to tell the government and the communist youth league, do not speculate. stir good things. what is the blind ginseng?

the government was not stupid, and i saw li ziyi's success and wanted to use it. in fact, maybe good intentions have become bad things. with my concept, the government, the communist youth league, the best leave her alone. it is not as good as the last four, truth, goodness and beauty.

ziyi, please be careful. no need to cooperate too deeply with the government. tell them to let you develop freely in accordance with their greatest interests. otherwise, the end may not be good for anyone.

cut!

during the seven years of labor in rural areas during the revolution, the hardships of the rural areas of china's rural areas know a little.

the reason why li ziyi feels is because most of the farm work that li ziyi has done has done it, and i will even accept the soles of the shoe. i rushed the cow to rake the ground in the paddy field, and i tried it. if you can't try it, you have to give it to the poor farmers around him. very difficult work. i did not dry the back of the mountain from the mountain. there are no bamboo or mountains there. almost all of the others can't be familiar. rice, wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, pigs and sheep beef, planting vegetables. we do not plant fruit trees. moving the bricks by myself and moving the bricks. at the age of seventeen, he was cooking for fifteen students.

li ziyi used bamboo to make a sofa for me too much. too admire!

ziyi, refueling ๅฟ…๏ธ do not worry about it. take your own way and let others have a way. don't ignore some people's words of talking nonsense.

ps

ziyi does not necessarily know the history of 12 million people starved in sichuan during the great famine. mianyang is the hardest hit area. please know. it is important to your future development.","最近李子柒担任“中国农村青年致富带头人推广大使”，引发新一轮评论热潮。看了一些，忍俊不禁，有感而发，希望能够提供不同视角。

关键是，希望大家平心静气，就事论事，尽量做到兼听则明。

不要语言欺凌一个勤劳勇敢聪慧的女孩子。

按照逮着老鼠就是好猫的说法，李子柒不啻是一只杰出的极其优秀的好猫。不说人民币收入，她大把大把的在国际舞台上赚美元，大概每天几万美元吧，羡煞众人，实现自己养家糊口侍奉奶奶的人生梦想，获得原本不敢奢望的收获，可喜可贺令人钦佩。

将近800万外国粉丝，大家是冲着视频展现的真善美来的。不服气？你试试就知道了。海外最红的自媒体华人江峰，28万订阅，已经是很多人崇拜的榜样。仅仅是这小姑娘的3%。

海外牛人郭文贵每次的视频也只是几万人看。李子柒的视频动辄五六百万。最好的3千万。三年前的视频还在被人每天搜索，点击量继续暴涨。

这可不是一般的奇迹。

我费了九牛二虎之力做视频，至今只有160订阅量，最好的一个视频1000多人观看。

我知道李子柒的分量。大家也掂量掂量。

大家议论最多，对李子柒误解最大的是，她不过是个演员，工作都是一个庞大的团队做的。

请稍微了解一下她的发展史。

李子柒有过不堪回首的童年少年，有过各种打工经验，有过很长时间一个人摸索实验失败，最后靠自己的才华，勤奋，努力，获得了成功。

现在状况，恐怕邀请张艺谋来做导演都有可能。当然李子柒不需要张艺谋我是打个比方。李子柒无师自通自学成才，表现出来的艺术天分，不比张艺谋差一丝一毫。

李子柒完全靠自己的努力走到今天。你们睁着眼睛瞎说八道，连基本的调查研究都不愿意做，恶意向一个勤劳致富的女孩子泼脏水。

真替你们脸红。Be kind. Don’t be so rude and hateful.

真：李子柒的真，不是表现在她穿着过于漂亮，不是表演在穿着什么样的鞋子在农田里劳作。在我的目光里，李子柒的真，表现在她的勤劳，吃苦耐劳，表现在她的心灵手巧。啥都会干。

她当然不会去认真刻意的表现四川绵阳农民的辛苦和今日农村贫困人群的苦难。李子柒追求的是订阅量，点击量。她的表现基本无懈可击。

李子柒真实的表现了她自己对生活的追求，她自己的生活状态。

当然要尽力美化。不然哪里来订阅量？

善：看她和奶奶相依为命，互相关照。想到奶奶终于过上好日子真为子柒高兴。

想起自己姥姥勤劳一生。李子柒的善良，是视频最大亮点之一。

美：毋庸赘言。令我感佩，从心底里佩服。有人又会说了，团队团队，大外宣等等。

你只需要去看看李子柒最早的视频就能感觉到她的艺术天分。

再说一遍：以李子柒目前日进斗金的状况，别说政府，任何一个有资金的人都会毫不犹豫甘作幕后团队。

大外宣：

这哪儿跟哪儿啊？什么大外宣？真是欲加之罪 何患无辞。一个女孩子混口饭吃，不小心大红大紫，别TM的瞎着眼胡说八道好不好？

但是此处敬告政府和共青团，别投机不成舍把米。把好事搅合了。瞎参和什么呢？

政府不傻，看到李子柒的成功趁机想利用起来。其实也许好心办成坏事儿。以我的观念，政府啊共青团啊什么的最好leave her alone. 免得最后四不像，真善美不在。

子柒也请慎重。不必和政府合作太深。告诉他们让你自由发展符合他们的最大利益。不然最后也许结局对谁都不好。

切切！

在下文革时期在农村劳动七年多，对中国农村的苦难农民的艰辛略知一二。

之所以感觉李子柒的真实，就是因为李子柒干过的农活儿大部分我都干过，我甚至会纳鞋底。赶着牛在水田里耙地，我试过。怎么试都不行只好交给身边的贫农代表。很不容易的活计。从山上砍竹子背下山没有干过。我们那里没有竹子也没有山。其它几乎都再熟悉不过。水稻，小麦，玉米，红薯，养猪羊牛，种菜。我们没有种水果树。自己盖房子搬砖头用手推车运转头。十七岁当炊事员专职为十五个同学做饭。

李子柒用竹子做沙发让我太佩服了。太佩服！

子柒，加油

PS

子柒不一定知道大饥荒时期四川饿死1200万人的历史。绵阳是重灾区。请一定了解一下。对你今后发展至关重要。"

when i said, 'knowing i shouldn't, if you are right....', i meant that i wouldn't disrespect or disregard or be ignorant of the hurt it might cause people who know the truth, whatever it may be, since i have no access to it, which is why, the former comment was followed by my desire of confirmation. don't conveniently choose to see one part and ignore the other. 
i can see your point that the subtitles are inconsistently strewn over videos, and had it been truly propaganda, it would have been differently so. wish you had said it sooner. 
as for me asking you to read the thread, i truly believed you didn't. since your comment about semantics was wrongly placed. i was talking about my language. however, i didn't mean to condescend to you, and if you felt bad about it, then i apologize. hope you will accept it. if you feel that, that was my intention, let me assure you it wasn't. and no, i don't mean that just because you belong from china, i see all chinese people that way. you have absolutely no grounds to base that upon. i merely enquired about it. and i am having a reasonably calm discussion with a stranger on a dangerous virtual platform, does that indicate that i am putting everyone in the same category? as for technology, i know for a fact that she has an imac, a professional editing machine. she edits her own videos. before you twist that as well, let me make it clear that she doesn't do it on her phone, is all i am saying. i can't help but feel like a lot of your feelings about my comments are culled from your perception of how the world sees china. and please stop seeing it from the angle that i am criticizing her videos. i can't press enough on the fact that i never did. i am very glad to know that she is a positive source of inspiration for the people of china. so please, i insist you stop dragging that cat through the mortar. i have been courteous to you, and apologized if your sentiments were hurt. i will have to request you stop misinterpreting my every word. and you did read things that you wanted to read. since i didn't mean them, i know i am speaking the truth. 
yes, every country does try to promote itself, and i will wager that a lot of it is actually propaganda. my country does it, so does the others. the difference is that the people have a right to prove them wrong on a public platform. we have the right to criticize them openly and call them on their misrepresentation. and here, the remark is about the government, not your culture or people. 
finally, i will reiterate that my intention was not to hurt your feelings. you think there was an ulterior motive. there wasn't. you think that i think the apples don't fall far from the tree. i don't. and my deduction was just that, presence of a crew. that could indicate a joint project of a political nature, but in this case, as you rightly suggested, it doesn't, since the subtitles are spare. 

now, i am tired of explaining things again and again. i hope you understand. and good day.","@DesignQQQ8905 hmm。好吧，我看到我的评论在哪里唱歌。让我清楚地表明您正在阅读很多东西。不，我并不是说，如果我看到中国的联合项目，我应该得出这样的结论：这是宣传。那是您的解释，希望您在看到错误时会承认自己的错误。因为那不是我的意思。
当我说：“知道我不应该，如果你对... ，由于我无法访问它，这就是为什么，前者的评论之后是我对确认的愿望。不要方便地选择看到一部分而忽略另一部分。
我可以看到您的观点是，字幕在视频上不一致，如果确实是宣传，那将是不同的。希望您早日说。
至于我要你阅读线程，我真的相信你没有。由于您对语义的评论被错误地放置了。我在谈论我的语言。但是，我并不是要屈服于您，如果您对此感到难过，那我深表歉意。希望你会接受。如果您觉得那是我的意图，让我向您保证不是。不，我并不是说仅仅因为您属于中国，我都会看到所有中国人。您绝对没有理由以此为基础。我只是询问它。而且我正在与一个危险的虚拟平台上的陌生人进行相当平静的讨论，这是否表明我将每个人都属于同一类别？至于技术，我知道她拥有一台专业编辑机器的iMac。她编辑自己的视频。我只说，在您扭转这一点之前，让我清楚地表明她不在手机上做到这一点。我忍不住想像您对世界如何看待中国的看法，您对我的评论的许多感觉都被淘汰了。并且请不要从我批评她的视频的角度看到它。我从未做过的事实不足。我很高兴知道她是中国人民的积极灵感。所以，我坚持要你停止将那只猫拖到砂浆上。我对你很有礼貌，如果你的情绪受伤，道歉。我将不得不要求您停止误解我的每个单词。您确实阅读了想阅读的东西。由于我不是他们的意思，所以我知道我在说实话。
是的，每个国家都试图提升自己，我会敢打赌，其中很多实际上都是宣传。我的国家也这样做，其他人也这样做。不同之处在于，人们有权在公共平台上证明他们是错误的。我们有权公开批评他们，并致电他们的虚假陈述。在这里，言论是关于政府的，而不是您的文化或人民。
最后，我将重申我的意图不是伤害您的感受。您认为存在别有用心。没有。您认为我认为苹果不会落在树上。我不。我的推论就是，船员的存在。这可能表明一个政治性质的联合项目，但是在这种情况下，正如您正确建议的那样，这不是，因为字幕是备用的。

现在，我厌倦了一次又一次的解释。我希望你明白。和美好的一天。"

38905,UgxOqWcCP9ANHogw_eF4AaABAg,0,4 years ago,"what is islam?
can we find an explanation of the great universe? is there any convincing interpretation of the secret of existence? we realize that no family can function properly without a responsible head, that no city can prosperously exist without sound administration, and that no state can survive without a leader of some kind. we also realize that nothing comes into being on its own. moreover, we observe that the universe exists and functions in the most orderly manner, and that it has survived for hundreds of thousand of years. can we then say that all this is accidental and haphazard? can we attribute the existence of man and the whole world to mere chance. โ€ man represents only a very small portion of the great universe. and if he can make plans and appreciate the merits of planning, then his own existence and the survival of the universe must also be a planned policy. this means that there is an extraordinary power to bring things into being and keep them moving in order.in the world then must be a great force in action to keep everything in order. in the beautiful nature there must be a great creator who creates the most charming pieces of art produces every thing for a special purpose in life. the deeply enlightened people recognize this creator and call him allah ""god"". he is not a man because no man can create or make another man. he is not an animal, nor he is a plant. he is neither an idol nor is he a statue of any kind because non of these things can make itself or create anything else. he is different from all these things because he is the maker and keeper of them all. the maker of anything must be different from and greater than things which he makes.โ€ there are various ways to know god ""allah'' and there are many things to tell about him. the great wonders and impressive marvels of the world are like open books in which we can read about god. besides, god himself comes to our aid through the many messengers and revelations he has sent down to man. these messengers and revelations tell us everything we need to know about god. โ€ the complete acceptance of the teachings and guidance of god 'allah' as revealed to his messengers muhammad is the religion of islam. islam enjoins faith in the oneness and sovereignty of allah, which makes man aware of meaningfulness of the universe and of his place in it. this belief frees him from all fears and superstitions by making him conscious of the presence of the almighty allah and of man's obligations towards him. this faith must be expressed and tested in actions, faith alone is not enough. belief in one god requires that we look upon all humanity as one family under the universal omnipotence of god the creator and nourisher of all. islam rejects the idea of chosen people, making belief in god and good actions the only way to heaven. thus, a direct relationship in established with god, without any intercessor.โ€ islam is not a new religion. it is, in essence, the same message and guidance which allah revealed to all prophets. adam, noah, abraham, ismael, david, moses and jesus (pbut). but the message which was revealed to prophet mohammed (pbut) is islam in its comprehensive, complete and final form.the quran is the last revealed word of allah and the basic source of islamic teachings and laws. the quran deals with the basis of creeds, morality, history of humanity, worship, knowledge, wisdom, god-man relationship, and human relationship in all aspects. comprehensive teaching on which, can be built sound systems of social justice, economics, politics, legislation, jurisprudence, law and international relations, are important contents of the quran. hadith, the teachings, sayings and actions of prophet mohammed (pbut), meticulously reported and collected by his devoted companions. explained and elaborated the quranic verses.โ€ the fundamental articles of faith in islam the true faithful muslim believes in the following principal articles of faith:- โ€ he believes in one god 'allah', supreme and eternal, infinite and mighty, merciful and compassionate, creator and provider. he believes in all messengers of god without any discrimination among them. every known nation had a warner or messenger from god. they were chosen by god to teach mankind and deliver his divine message. the quran mentions the name of twenty five of them. among them mohammad stands as the last messenger and the crowning glory of the foundation of prophethood. muslin believes in all scriptures and revelations of god. they were the guiding light which the messengers received to show their respected peoples the right path of god. in the quran a special reference is made to the books of abraham, moses, david and jesus. but long before the revelations has been lost or corrupted. the only authentic and complete book of god in existence in the quran. the true muslim believes in the angels of allah. they are purely spiritual and splendid beings whose nature requires on food, drink or sleep. they spend their days and nights in the worship of god. muslim believes in the last day of judgement. this world will come to an end someday, and the dead will rise to stand for their final and fair trial. people with good records will be generously, rewarded and warmly welcomed to the heaven of allah, and those with bad records will be punished and cast into hell. muslim believes in the timeless knowledge of god and his power to plan and execute his planes and nothing could happen in his kingdom against his will. his knowledge and power are in action at all times and command over his creation. he is wise and merciful, and whatever he does must have a meaningful purpose. if this is established in our mind and hearts, we should accept with good faith all that he does, although we may fail to under stand it fully, or think it is bad. the five pillars of islamโ€ faith without actions arid practice is a dead end, as far as islam is concerned. faith by nature is very sensitive and can be most effective. when it is not out of practice or out of use, it quickly loses its liveliness and motivation power. there are five pillars of islam:โ€ the declaration of faith: to bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except allah, and that mohammad (pbuh) is his messenger to all human beings till the day of judgment. the prophethood of mohammad obliges the muslims to follow, his exemplary life as a model. prayers: daily, prayers are offered five times a day as a duty towards allah. they strengthen and enliven the belief in allah and inspire man to a higher morality. they purify the heart and prevent temptation towards wrong - doings and evil. fasting the month of ramadan. the muslims during the month of ramadan not only abstain from food, drink and sexual intercourse from dawn to sunset but also sincerity and devotion. it develops a sound social conscience, patience, unselfishness and will - power. zakkah: the literal and simple meaning of zakkah is purity. the technical meaning of this word designates the annual amount in kind or coin which a muslim with means must distribute among the rightful beneficiaries. but the religious and spiritual significance of zakkah is much deeper and more lively. so it has humanitarian and sociopolitical values. hajj (pilgrimage to makkah): it is to be performed once in a lifetime, if one can afford it financially and physically","什么是伊斯兰教？
我们可以找到大宇宙的解释吗？对存在秘密有令人信服的解释吗？我们意识到，没有负责任的头脑，没有一个家庭可以正常运作，没有任何城市就可以在没有合理的管理的情况下繁荣，没有某种领导者就无法生存。我们还意识到，没有任何东西可以自己。此外，我们观察到宇宙以最有序的方式存在和功能，并且它已经幸存了数十万年。然后，我们可以说所有这些都是偶然而偶然的吗？我们可以将人和整个世界的存在归因于机会吗？人只代表大宇宙的一小部分。而且，如果他可以制定计划并欣赏计划的优点，那么他自己的存在和宇宙的生存也必须是计划的政策。这意味着有非凡的力量将事物带入生存并保持它们的秩序。在世界上，必须是使一切保持秩序的重要力量。在美丽的大自然中，必须有一个伟大的创造者，他创造了最迷人的艺术作品，为人生的特殊目的而产生了所有东西。深深的人认识到这个创造者，并将他称为“上帝”。他不是一个男人，因为没有人可以创造或创造另一个男人。他不是动物，也不是植物。他既不是偶像，也不是任何形式的雕像，因为这些事情中的任何东西都能使自己造就或创造其他任何东西。他与所有这些事情有所不同，因为他是所有人的制造商和守护者。任何事物的创造者都必须与他所做的事情不同。有多种认识上帝的方式“真主”，还有很多关于他的事情要说的事情。世界上的奇迹和令人印象深刻的奇迹就像开放我们可以阅读关于上帝的书籍。此外，上帝本人通过他寄给人的许多使者和启示来援助我们的援助。这些使者和启示告诉我们我们需要了解的关于上帝的一切。完全接受向他的使者穆罕默德揭示的上帝“真主”的教义和指导是伊斯兰教的宗教。伊斯兰教禁止对真主的统一和主权信仰，这使得人意识到宇宙的有意义和他在其中的意义。这种信仰自由。他从所有的恐惧和迷信中意识到全能真主的存在以及人对他的义务的存在。人类是一个家庭，在上帝的普遍无所不能下，都是所有人的创造者和滋养者。伊斯兰教拒绝选择人民的想法，使对上帝的信仰和善行的信仰成为通往天堂的唯一途径。因此，在没有任何代祷者的情况下与上帝建立的直接关系。伊斯兰教不是一种新宗教。从本质上讲，这是真主向所有先知透露的相同的信息和指导。亚当，诺亚，亚伯拉罕，伊斯梅尔，大卫，摩西和耶稣（pbut）。但是向先知穆罕默德（PBUT）揭示的信息是伊斯兰教的全面，完整和最终的形式。《古兰经》是安拉的最后一个揭示的话，也是伊斯兰教义和法律的基本来源。古兰经涉及信条，道德，人类历史，崇拜，知识，智慧，神人的关系和人类关系的基础。可以在其中构建社会正义，经济学，政治，法学，法律和国际关系的全面教学，这是古兰经的重要内容。圣训，先知穆罕默德（PBUT）的教义，俗语和行为，由他的虔诚同伴精心报告和收集。解释并阐述了古兰经诗句。伊斯兰教信仰的基本文章真正忠实的穆斯林相信以下主要的信仰文章： - 他相信一个神的“阿拉”，至高无上，永恒，无限，无限，强大，仁慈，慈悲，富有同情心，创建者和提供商。他相信上帝的所有使者，而没有任何歧视。每个已知的国家都有来自上帝的华纳或信使。上帝被上帝选中教人类并传达他的神圣信息。古兰经提到了其中25个名称。其中，穆罕默德（Mohammad）站在了最后一个使者和预言基础的荣耀。平纹细布相信上帝的所有经文和启示。他们是使者收到的指导光，向他们尊敬的民族展示了上帝的正确道路。在古兰经中，特别提到了亚伯拉罕，摩西，大卫和耶稣的书。但是很久以前，启示已经丢失或腐败。古兰经中唯一的真实而完整的上帝。真正的穆斯林相信真主的天使。它们纯粹是精神和灿烂的生物，其性质需要食物，饮料或睡眠。他们白天和黑夜都在敬拜上帝上。穆斯林相信审判的最后一天。这个世界将有一天结束，死者将为他们的最后和公正的审判而崛起。拥有良好记录的人将受到慷慨，回报和热烈欢迎真主的天堂，那些记录不良的人将受到惩罚并陷入地狱。穆斯林相信对上帝的永恒知识以及他计划和执行他的飞机的能力，他的王国在他的意愿中没有任何事情发生。他的知识和力量在任何时候都在行动，并为他的创造而指挥。他是明智而仁慈的，他所做的一切都必须具有有意义的目的。如果在我们的思想和心灵中建立这一点，我们应该真诚地接受他所做的一切，尽管我们可能无法完全站立，或者认为这是不好的。就伊斯兰教而言，伊斯兰信仰的五个支柱无需采取行动。信仰天生非常敏感，可以最有效。当它不执行或无法使用时，它很快就会失去活力和动力。伊斯兰教有五个支柱：信仰宣言：见证，除了阿拉以外，没有什么值得敬拜的，而穆罕默德（pbuh）是他在审判日之前向所有人传播的使者。穆罕默德（Mohammad）的预言使穆斯林不得不遵循他的模范生活。祈祷：每天，每天祈祷五次作为对真主的责任。他们加强并充实了对真主的信仰，并激发了人类更高的道德。他们净化心脏并防止对错误的诱惑 - 行为和邪恶。禁食斋月月。在斋月月，穆斯林不仅避免了从黎明到日落的食物，饮料和性交，而且还要诚意和奉献。它发展出合理的社会良心，耐心，无私和意志 - 力量。 Zakkah：Zakkah的文字和简单含义是纯度。这个词的技术含义指定了穆斯林必须在应有的受益人中分配的年度金额或硬币。但是Zakkah的宗教和精神意义更加深入，更加生动。因此，它具有人道主义和社会政治价值观。朝j（前往麦加朝圣）：一生将进行一次，如果可以在财务上和身体上负担得起"
