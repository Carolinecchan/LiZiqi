everyone. all must be love. god overwhelmed.
together.

[easy to solve] as long as it is a person, it is similar, regardless of ethnic, human, gender, and religious beliefs, they should love each other. it is also the transformation of the heavens and the earth, and it should not be distinguished by you and me, and cooperate with each other to maintain this symbiotic and prosperous life community.
❤
those who are tall. the name is high. people are emphasized.
non -appearance. great person. look at it.
people are convinced. nothing.
❤
[easy to solve] the nobility of virtue is naturally high. everyone respects his virtue, not appearance. those who have talented people have excellent ability to deal with things, and their reputation is naturally extraordinary. however, what people admire and admire are his ability to do things, not because he is good at boasting.
❤
i have the ability. don't be selfish. people can.
don't be light. don't be rich. don't be proud.
don't hate it. don't like new. people are not idle.
don't stir. people are uneasy. don't disturb.

[easy to solve] when you have the ability to serve everyone, don't be selfish, just consider yourself, reluctant to pay. for the talents of others, you should learn, appreciate, and admire, not criticism, jealousy, and slander. don't please be rich, and don't be proud of themselves in front of the poor, or despise them. you should not like the new and hate the old. you must cherish old friends or old things, and do not be greedy for new friends or new things. when others are busy, don't disturb him. when others are in a bad mood or are physically and mentally arbitrary, don't gossip to interfere with him and increase his troubles and anxiety.

people know it. the more thoughtful. promote evil.
that is evil. different. mainly.
good persuasion. germany is built. out of irregularity.
two losses.

[easy to solve] don't expose the shortcomings of others. the privacy of others should not be publicized. the advantages or good deeds of praise of others are good deeds. when the other party hears your praise, it will definitely encourage good deeds. zhang yang's faults or disadvantages of others are to do evil. if criticism is too much, it will also recruit themselves. friends should have persuaded each other and build good moral cultivation together. if there are mistakes, you can't persuade each other, both of them will have defects.

i don't want to. that is, ourselves. encounter.
forgotten. short resentment. the reward is long.

[easy to solve] the acquisition or granted of property must be clearly understood. it is better to give others more people. before you add things to others, or ask others to do things, you must ask yourself: ""if you change it to me, would i like it?"" if you do n’t even want to do it, you must stop immediately. remember to repay. others are sorry for themselves, and they should forget it. don't remember the resentment for too long in your heart, even if you're in the past. other people have to remember to be in mind, grateful, and often repay.
❤
wait for the servant. you are expensive. although expensive.
mercy and wide. attocked. no heart.

[easy to solve] to treat the maids and servants in the home, we must pay attention to the righteousness and lead by example. although it is important, it is more valuable. if the battle is forced to obey, the other party will inevitably be convinced. only by serving people can others not complain.

unexpectedly. the color is not charming. can kiss.

bailing bad.

[easy to solve] it is also human, good, evil and evil, and mental heights are uneven. there are many people affected by the vulgarity, and there are few people with kindness and generosity. if they are really benevolent, everyone naturally fears him, because he speaks fair and selflessly without concealment, and does not please others, so everyone will naturally be awesome. those who can get close to rende and learn from him are very lucky, because he will make our virtue progress every day, and the fault will decrease one day. if you are not willing to get close to the gentlemen of the people, there will be endless scourge, because the unscrupulous villain will approach us while it is false, and our words and deeds will be affected by bad words, and even the whole life will enter the wrong direction.

文 ❤ 
do not work. but learn text. long flashy.
whoever. but do it. don't learn text.
let's see it. amazing.

[easy to solve] can't do filial piety, 悌, jin, faith, pan -loving, and relatives, and blindly study. even if there are some knowledge, it is just a habit that has increased its fascinating and unrealistic. what is the use? if you just keep your teachings and refuse to study, it is easy to do it because of unknown things and cause mistakes according to your own prejudice. this is also wrong.

reading. three arrives. eye.
believe. read this. don't admire.
this is not the end. don't get up. width is limited.
tightly use it. worked. stady.
suspicious. sui notes. just ask.
seeking meaning.

[easy to solve] the method of reading should be focused on three arrival: eye, mouth, and heart, the three are indispensable, so that the effect of getting more effort can be received. study science must be dedicated to deepen, and you ca n’t start reading this book before it can be read. he also enviouss other books and wants to read other books. this will never be able to read a book in depth. you must read this book to read another one. when setting a reading plan, you may wish to relax. in actual implementation, you must step up hard work and strictly implement it. you must not be lazy. the daily accumulation of the month was deeply worked, and the original unreasonable and doubtful doubts were naturally solved. when you have any questions in your heart, you should take notes at any time. as soon as you have a chance, you should ask the good teacher yiyou. be sure to understand its true meaning.

the room is clear. the wall is clean. several cases are clean.
the pen is zheng. ink grind. both heart.
the word is disrespectful. heart disease. list of classics.
there is a fixed. after reading. restore.
although there is anxiety. crushed. there is a shortage.
just make up. non -holy books. don't look at the screen.
well. bad heart. don't violently.
don't give up. holy and xian. tame.

[easy to solve] the study should be sorted and cleaned, and the walls should be kept clean. when reading, stationery such as pen and ink, paper, and other stationery should be neat and messy, and all of them are in order to calm down to read. the ancients should use a brush to write ink first. if they were absent, the ink would be missed. if the words written are crooked, it means that you are impetuous and your heart cannot be determined. books should be divided into different categories, arranged neatly, placed in a fixed position, and they must be returned to the restore place after reading. although there is an urgent matter to leave, take the book and leave it before leaving. the book is the crystallization of wisdom. if there is a defect, it must be repaired and keeps complete. it is not a book that preach the words and deeds of sages and bad books that are harmful to physical and mental health. they should abandon and not read, so as not to be polluted, wisdom, and ambitions to become unhealthy. when you encounter difficulties or setbacks, don't abandon yourself, don't have to be cynical, complain about the world, you should be angry and study hard. although the realm of sages is high, it can be achieved in order. ❤

disciples are easy to solve (end)
title: disciples three -character sutra
filial scriptures are easy to solve. welcome to print.
❤ minglun teach filial piety
read thousands of times. it is self -explanatory.
implement life. it really does.

the disciples' name is ""xunmengwen"", which was made by li yuxiu, a talented talent in the kangxi period of the qing dynasty. its content adopts the sixth articles of ""the analects of confucius"": ""the disciples enter the filial piety, and they are brothers, and they believe in the people, and they love the public, and they have the power to learn."" sentence yiyun compilation is divided into five parts to perform; specifically listed on the etiquette and norms that the children are at home, out of the country, taking care of people, studying, and studying. later, after the revision of jia cunren in the qing dynasty, it was renamed ""disciples regulations"". it was the best reading of enlightenment and educating children dunlun to prevent evil and consciousness, and develop a loyal family style.
title: changli
1. family affairs, do not say to outsiders.
for example, if you talk about the economic situation at home, the place where your family usually goes out, or when the family is expected to go, in case of the thief or someone who is interested, they will break through the empty door and do bad things.
in addition, the ancients said that the family was ugly. if complains and accusing their families of listening to outsiders, others could not help you solve the problem. it would not only hurt the dignity of the family, but also made outsiders impress your family. or outsiders pass the housework you said as a gossip. if the sky is chaotic and then spread back to your ears, it will not only be unable to argue, but also increase the family's heart.

2. buddhism: knowing that more methods are actually giving.
❤ faiba: wisdom and wisdom.
i often read the ancient sage books and do their best. let the general public pay attention to moral cultivation and distinguish between right and wrong, so that they will not argue with others or sin.
❤ 富。。.
foreign wealth is something outside of the body, money, clothes, food, etc., provided to those in need.
inner wealth is his own body. at home, we help our family to do housework, serve our family with our bodies, and help the poor to help the poor disadvantage. this is all fortune. only can it be available.
❤ the fearless giving is the reason, the obtained fruit is healthy and longevity.
everything is terrifying, fearful, and threatened by life. you help him leave all horror and let him be physically and mentally stable. this is called fearless giving.

3. see the person who is lost, don't say proud.
(those who understand the feelings of others can always think about others.)
when he encounters frustrated, sad, and lost people, he has been hit in all aspects and is very unhappy. it should be said that he can comfort him, instead of saying how much he is.
when others break their fortunes and lose their jobs, you say that you are promoted to get rich, which will make the other party even more unbearable. pride and pride itself is evil, let alone hurt people?
on the contrary, the mood that can be eliminated by others' nervousness or anxiety is good. even if you ca n’t help you, do n’t go down. don't do it because of goodness, don't do it because of evil.
it is not only violence and crime called evil deeds. the evil thoughts that people often can't stop are the source of disaster.
welcome to print. bleak","弟子规（3）
❤泛爱众
凡是人。皆须爱。天同覆。
地同载。

【易解】 只要是人，就是同类，不分族群、人种、性别、宗教信仰，皆应相亲相爱。同是天地所化育覆载的，应该不分你我，互助合作，才能维持这个共生共荣的生命共同体。
❤
行高者。名自高。人所重。
非貌高。才大者。望自大。
人所服。非言大。
❤
【易解】 德行高尚者，名望自然高显，大家所敬重的是他的德行，不是外表容貌。有才能的人，处理事情的能力卓越，声望自然不凡，然而人们所欣赏佩服的，是他的处事能力，而不是因为他擅于夸耀。
❤
己有能。勿自私。人所能。
勿轻訾。勿谄富。勿骄贫。
勿厌故。勿喜新。人不闲。
勿事搅。人不安。勿话扰。

【易解】 当你有能力可以为众人服务的时候，不要自私自利，只考虑到自己，舍不得付出。对于他人的才华，应当学习、欣赏、赞叹，而不是批评、嫉妒、毁谤。不要去讨好巴结富有的人，也不要在穷人面前骄傲自大，或者轻视他们。更不可以喜新厌旧，对于老朋友或旧事物要珍惜，对于新朋友或新事物不要贪恋。当别人正在忙碌的时候，不要去打扰他，当别人心情不好或身心欠安的时候，不要闲言闲语去干扰他，增加他的烦恼与不安。
❤
人有短。切莫揭。人有私。
切莫说。道人善。即是善。
人知之。愈思勉。扬人恶。
即是恶。疾之甚。祸且作。
善相劝。德皆建。过不规。
道两亏。

【易解】 别人的缺点，不要去揭穿。别人的隐私，切忌去张扬。赞美他人的优点或善行，就是行善。当对方听到你的称赞之后，必定会更加勉励行善。张扬他人的过失或缺点，就是行恶，如果指责批评太过分了，还会给自己招来灾祸。朋友之间应该互相规过劝善，共同建立良好的品德修养。如果有错不能互相规劝，两个人的品德都会有缺陷。
❤
凡取与。贵分晓。与宜多。
取宜少。将加人。先问己。
己不欲。即速己。恩欲报。
怨欲忘。报怨短。报恩长。

【易解】 财物的取得或给予，一定要分办清楚明白，宁可多给别人，自己少拿一些，才能广结善缘，与人和睦相处。要将事物加到别人身上，或要托别人做事之前，先要反问自己：「如果换成是我，我愿意吗？」如果连自己都不愿意，就要立刻停止。受人恩惠要记得报答。别人有对不起自己的事，应该宽大为怀把它忘掉。怨恨不平的事不要记在心中太久，过去就算了。别人对我们的恩德，则要铭记在心，感恩不忘，常思报答。
❤
待婢仆。身贵端。虽贵端。
慈而宽。势服人。心不然。
理服人。方无言。

【易解】 对待家中的婢女与仆人，要注重自己的品行端正并以身作则。虽然品行端正很重要，但是仁慈宽大更可贵。如果仗势强逼别人服从，对方难免口服心不服。唯有以理服人，别人才会心悦诚服没有怨言。

同是人。类不齐。流俗众。
仁者希。果仁者。人多畏。
言不讳。色不媚。能亲仁。
无限好。德日进。过日少。
不亲仁。无限害。小人进。
百事坏。

【易解】 同样是人，善恶邪正、心智高低却是良莠不齐。受风气流俗影响的人多，仁慈宽厚的人少。如果是真正有仁德的人，大家自然敬畏他，因为他说话公正无私没有隐瞒，又不讨好他人，所以大家自然会起敬畏之心。能够亲近仁德的人，向他学习，是很幸运的事，因为他会使我们的德行一天比一天进步，过错也跟着一天天减少。如果不肯亲近仁人君子，就会有无穷的祸害，因为不肖的小人会趁虚来接近我们，日积月累，我们的言行思想都会受到不良的影响，甚至使整个人生走入错误的方向。


不力行。但学文。长浮华。
成何人。但力行。不学文。
任己见。昧理真。

【易解】 不能身体力行孝、悌、谨、信、泛爱众、亲仁这些本分，一味死读书，纵然有些知识，也只是增长自己浮华不实的习气，变成一个不切实际的人，如此读书又有何用？如果只是谨守教诲，却不肯读书学习，就容易因不明事理，而依自己的偏见行事，造成错误而不自知，这也是不对的。

读书法。有三到。心眼口。
信皆要。方读此。勿慕彼。
此未终。彼勿起。宽为限。
紧用功。工夫到。滞塞通。
心有疑。随札记。就人问。
求确义。

【易解】 读书的方法要注重三到：眼到、口到、心到，三者缺一不可，如此方能收到事半功倍的效果。研究学问要专一、专精才能深入，不能这本书才开始读没多久，又欣羡其他的书，想看其他的书，这样永远也定不下心把一本书好好深入读通。必须把这本书读完，才能再读另外一本。在订定读书计画的时候，不妨宽松一些，实际执行时，就要加紧用功，严格执行，不可以懈怠偷懒。日积月累功夫深了，原先窒碍不通、困顿疑惑之处，自然而然都迎刃而解了。求学当中，心里有疑问时，应随时笔记，一有机会，就向良师益友请教，务必确实明白它的真义。

房室清。墙壁净。几案洁。
笔砚正。墨磨偏。心不端。
字不敬。心先病。列典籍。
有定处。读看毕。还原处。
虽有急。卷束齐。有缺坏。
就补之。非圣书。屏勿视。
蔽聪明。坏心志。勿自暴。
勿自弃。圣与贤。可驯致。

【易解】 书房要整理清洁，墙壁要保持干净。读书时，书桌上笔墨纸砚等文具要摆放整齐不凌乱，触目所及皆是井然有条，才能静下心来读书。古人写字使用毛笔先要磨墨，如果心不在焉，墨就会磨偏了。写出来的字如果歪歪斜斜，就表示你浮躁不安，心定不下来。书本应该分门别类，排列整齐，放在固定的位置，阅读完毕须归还原处。虽有急事要离开，也要把书本收好再离开。书本是智慧的结晶，有缺损就要修补，保持完整。不是传述圣贤言行的著作，以及有害身心健康的不良书刊，都应该摒弃不看，以免身心受到污染、智慧遭受蒙蔽、心志变得不健康。遇到困难或挫折的时候，不要自暴自弃，也不必愤世嫉俗、怨天尤人，应该发愤向上努力学习。圣贤境界虽高，循序渐进，也是可以达到的。 ❤

弟子规易解（终）
书名：弟子规 三字经 
孝经 易解。欢迎翻印。
❤明伦教孝
读书千遍。其意自现。
落实生活。确实做到。

弟子规原名＜训蒙文＞，为清朝康熙年间秀才李毓秀所作。其内容采用《论语》学而篇第六条：「弟子入则孝，出则弟，谨而信，泛爱众，而亲仁，行有余力，则以学文。」的文义以三字一句，两句一韵编纂而成，分为五个部份加以演述；具体列举出为人子弟在家、出外、待人接物、求学应有的礼仪与规范，特别讲求家庭教育与生活教育。后经清朝贾存仁修订改编，并改名为＜弟子规＞，是启蒙养正，教育子弟敦伦尽份防邪存诚，养成忠厚家风的最佳读物。
书名：常礼举要
1.家庭之事，不可向外人言。
举例来说，如果你讲到家里的经济状况、家人平常出入的地点，或是什么时间家人预计要去哪里，万一被小偷或是有心人士打听到了，他们会闯空门、做坏事。
另外，古人说家丑不可外扬，若是抱怨、指责家人给外人听，别人也不能帮你解决问题，不仅会伤害家人的尊严，也让让外人对你们一家印象不佳。又或者外人把你说的家务事都当成闲谈八卦传出去，若是说得天花乱坠再传回你耳中，不仅百口莫辩，也徒增一家人心里难受。

2.佛教：知道得到更多的方法其实是布施。
❤法布施：得聪明智慧。
常常读古圣贤书，并身体力行。让社会大众能够注重品德修养，能够分辨是非，才不会与人争执或是犯罪。
❤财布施得财富、功德。
外财就是身外之物，钱、衣服、食物等，提供给需要的人。
内财是自己身体。我们在家里面，帮助家人做家事，用我们的身体为家人服务，在外做义工帮助贫困弱势这都是财布施。能舍才有得。
❤无畏布施是因，得到的果报是健康长寿。
万物有恐怖、有畏惧、生命受到威胁，你帮助他离开一切恐怖，让他身心安稳，这叫无畏布施。

3.见失意人，不说得意语。
（明白别人感受的人总是能够多为别人着想呢。）
遇到失意、伤心、失落的人，他各方面都受到打击，很不得意，应该说点让他得到安慰的话，而不是说自己有多在行、多厉害。
当别人破了财，丢了工作，你却说自己升官发财，这会让对方更加不堪忍受。傲慢、骄傲本身即是恶，更何况用来伤人？
相反的，能够免除别人紧张恐惧或是忧虑的心情即是善，即便帮不上忙也千万不要落井下石。勿因善小而不为，勿因恶小而为之。
并非只有暴力、犯罪才叫恶行，人常常止不住的恶念也是灾难的源头。

in the distant past, the world of noah's life was like such corruption today. at that time, god regretted making people (all people thought at that time were all evil), so god wiped out with the floods (only stayed in staying (only stayed in staying because of his ""fear of god""), human ancestor adam, adam, chose to accept the temptation and did not follow god. from then on, he entered the world. today, our world, enjoy the convenience brought by technology, the emergence of the internet , make the world a global village, but people's relationships have become more complicated, violent porn information, etc., constantly seduce the world to sin, we live in a world of deceit happy, no longer respect others. this lifestyle makes us more and more farther away from god. it is also unpleasant to god. many people do not know the god who creates the universe or does not want to know god, does not want to know the gospel. it is superstitious, but the bible tells us that god was the versatile god that was in the past and eternal in the past, and god hated ""sin"". no longer the same, we have lost eternal life, life is limited, and god has set a day to judge the world according to the people (jesus) set up by his (jesus). god loves the world. the only sons jesus became a flesh, nailed to ten, and the life of our sinful life with his innocent life was resurrected three days after his death. sitting on the right of god jehovah, so that we could pardon through jesus, repentance and was baptized. the holy spirit believes that jesus becomes a savior, so that we have a new style, and then live according to the inspiration of the bible. jesus said: you have a lot of love for people, and you have more forgiveness. ; what amount do you use to give you, and what amount to use will be used to give you .. similar teaching bibles are inspired. if we are willing to obey, we will have the opportunity to save.

we live in the scientific era, and people no longer believe in god, but we can't see that it does not mean nothing. the busy life makes us have no time to think. what will we face after death? since the outbreak of the new crown virus, we are becoming more and more feeling the impermanence and fragility of life, jesus told us in lujia gospel: a sinner repent, and he must also happy for him in the sky, and he is more happy than ninety -nine righteous people who do not have to repent. god loves us to be close to him. we are all created in the style of god. we must never be punished because of sin, so the last days have been extended for a long time. they are looking for those who belong to him.
the gospel of john mentioned: jesus said, ""i am the road, truth, and life, and no one can get to the father if she doesn't use me.
dear friend, jesus christ is the grace of god. god's mercy on the world allows us to receive this grace in vain without paying any cost. the choice, please study the bible (with app) to understand god's grace and jesus' teaching of sin, or go to the church to understand the gospel, (there is a fake blessing to confuse the world, we need to distinguish it) family, i wish you peace.","面对这个人心愈来愈败坏ˋ天灾人祸不断的世界,人们冲突愈来愈多,不法的事情也愈来愈多,许多人的爱心渐渐冷淡,这些世界的景况,耶稣在马太福音里就有提到:你们将听见打仗和打仗的风声，不要惊慌。这些事是必须有的，只是末期还没有到。民要攻打民，国要攻打国；多处必有地震、饥荒。这都是灾难的起头..

在遥远的过去,挪亚生活的年代世界就犹如今天这样的败坏,当时神后悔造人(那时的人所思所想尽都是恶),于是神就用大洪水灭绝所有人(只有留下挪亚因为他""敬畏神""),人类祖先亚当ˋ夏娃选择接受诱惑而不顺从上帝,从此罪就入了世界,时至今日我们的世界,享受科技带来的便利性,网路的出现,让世界成为一个地球村,但是人们的关系也变的复杂,暴力ˋ色情资讯等等,不断的在诱惑世人犯罪,我们就生活一个诡诈ˋ谎言ˋ贪婪ˋ欲望无止境的世界里,人们追求自我快乐,不再尊重其他人,这样的生活方式让我们离上帝愈来愈遥远,也是上帝不喜悦的,很多人不清楚创造宇宙的上帝或者不想了解上帝,不想知道福音,认为时代那么进步这都是迷信,但是圣经告诉我们上帝是昔在ˋ今在ˋ以后永在的全能神,并且上帝恨恶""罪"",在亚当ˋ夏娃选择不顺从神的结果,让我们因为罪和圣洁的神属性不再一样,我们也失去永生,生命受到限制,而神已经定了日子，要借着祂所设立的人(耶稣)按公义审判天下,神爱世人.上帝在二千年前差了祂的独生子耶稣道成肉身,钉上十架,以祂无罪的生命代替我们有罪的生命赎罪,死后三天复活,坐在上帝耶和华神的右边,让我们可以借着耶稣罪得赦免,悔改ˋ受洗ˋ领受圣灵ˋ相信耶稣成为救主,让我们有新生的样式,之后按照圣经的启示来生活,耶稣说:您对人付出的爱多,您的赦免就多,你们怎样论断人，也必怎样被论断；你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们..类似的教导圣经都有启示,如果我们愿意顺服,都有机会得救.

我们活在科学时代,人不再相信有神,,不过看不到不代表没有,忙碌的生活让我们没有时间思考,人死后接下要面对什么?自从新冠病毒爆发以来,我们愈来愈感到生命的无常以及脆弱,耶稣在路加福音告诉我们:一个罪人悔改，在天上也要这样为他欢喜，较比为九十九个不用悔改的义人欢喜更大。神是喜爱我们亲近祂的,我们都是按着神的样式造的,绝对不要我们因为罪而受罚,所以末后的日子延长了很久,(耶稣离开2千年了)神要世人悔改归向祂,天天都在寻找归向祂的人.
约翰福音提到:耶稣说“我就是道路、真理、生命若不借着我，没有人能到父那里。
亲爱的朋友,耶稣基督就是神的恩典,神怜悯世人让我们不用付出什么代价就可以白白的领受这个恩典,末世的征兆愈来愈显明,在有限的生命里尽快的接受福音绝对是您最好的选择,恳请您研读圣经(有app)来了解神的恩典以及耶稣对罪的教导,或是到教会了解福音,(有假福音在迷惑世人,需要明辨)让我们一同进入神国的大家庭,祝平安ˋ喜乐."
