when it comes to food, don't think those who are rejected only eat garbage. instead, they learned to find nutrition in the neglected meat and vegetables. they learned to clean, cut pieces, seasoned and stewed wild vegetables and meat, some household vegetables and meats ignored in the food market, and learned to use aromatic wood cigarettes (such as mountain walnuts, walnuts and bean shrubs

20153,Ugy2JIei5Rk0MEDBhgF4AaABAg.919L3UszMwJ91o-5lg7zpI,4,"@johnvuu4679 there is so much land on this earth, have you even driven anywhere? have you ever left the city you live in? cities are tiny little specs compared to what is out there. 

and yes, not all land is fertile, that's why you don't try to live in a desert like all the morons in arizona and many other places. you can turn many deserts into grassland: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpthi7o66pi&t=4s 

we grow fields upon fields upon fields of corn and soy to make garbage food that makes us sick while having useless lawns to show off to our neighbors that we can use a lawnmower when we could be making prime habitats for massive herds of animals that we can use as never ending food sources.

you can't afford to live off the land? that makes no sense, do you understand the concept here? you're living off the land, you don't need money.. nobody needs money for anything. it's worthless paper and digits in computers. you realize a couple hundred years ago people just rode wagons across america and picked a spot to settle right? i don't know the immediate answer to how to get land distributed to people who are willing to homestead, that's the hard part. i definitely wouldn't want the government involved. there is no easy solution for it, but the alternative is much worse. houses will be completely unaffordable throughout the world some day, and we'll all be even more of slaves to the corporate systems and governments than we already are. just wait, or just wait for your children to see... it's going to be a fucking nightmare. and it's going to happen, you're not getting the world to homestead, nobody is doing it. we're going the other direction and it's not stoppable.

ya, the population is growing, but as i said, you don't seem to have a clue how much land is out there, and people who cannot live off the land shouldn't be living.. why do you think we got into this situation? we cater to every little desire and whim of everybody all in the name of profit. if you have a strong family and community you can live off the land, anybody can do it, it's just a matter of not being a coddled sheltered half ass human being.

sure.. we've dug ourselves into a hole by chasing the dollars and carrots in front of our faces for centuries, but the solution has been staring us in the face the entire time.. most people are just too lazy and don't want to give up their lives of convenience for an honest living off the land. if you don't want an honest lifestyle living off the land and you want to live in a city full of conveniences and cancers then you're the problem. but you're in good company, probably 99% of people think that way. 

social backlash? like the social backlash from politics, unjust laws, and profiteering? just wait, you haven't even seen social backlash yet, this world is about to explode with social backlash. you're going to wish you had a homestead off the grid when it does.

the fact that i have to explain this to people shows how far gone the majority of mankind is. it's almost a shame that god has promised not to flood the earth again, we could really use a reset.","@johnvuu4679地球上有很多土地，你甚至在任何地方开车吗？您是否曾经离开过您居住的城市？与那里的城市相比，城市的规格很小。

是的，并非所有的土地都是肥沃的，这就是为什么您不像亚利桑那州和其他许多地方那样尝试生活在沙漠中的原因。您可以将许多沙漠变成草地：https：//www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpthi7o66pi&t=4S

我们在玉米和大豆的田地上种植田地，以制作垃圾食品，使我们生病，而无用的草坪可以向我们的邻居炫耀，我们可以在我们可以为大量动物群创造主要栖息地时使用割草机，我们可以使用割草机。用作永无止境的食物来源。

您负担不起居住的土地吗？那没有道理，您在这里了解这个概念吗？您在土地上生活，不需要钱..没人需要任何钱。这是毫无价值的纸和计算机中的数字。您意识到几百年前，人们只是骑着货车在整个美国都骑着货车，并选择了一个地点来定居吗？我不知道如何将土地分配给愿意居住的人的直接答案，这是困难的部分。我绝对不希望政府参与其中。没有简单的解决方案，但是替代方案更糟。有一天，全世界的房屋将完全负担不起，与我们现在相比，我们所有人都将成为公司系统和政府的奴隶。等一下，或者等待您的孩子看到...这将是一场他妈的噩梦。这将发生，您不会让世界进入宅基地，没有人在做。我们朝另一个方向前进，这是不可停止的。

是的，人口正在增长，但是正如我说的那样，您似乎不知道那里有多少土地，而无法生活的人不应该生存。这个情况？我们以利润的名义迎合每个人的每一个小小的渴望和兴起。如果您有一个强大的家庭和社区，您可以在土地上生活，任何人都可以做到这一点，这只是一个不做一个顽固的庇护半屁股人的问题。

当然..我们已经通过在脸前追着美元和胡萝卜数百年来挖掘了一个洞，但是解决方案一直在整个脸上盯着我们。想要放弃他们的便利生活，以诚实地生活在土地上。如果您不希望诚实的生活方式在土地上生活，而是想住在一个充满便利和癌症的城市中，那么您就是问题所在。但是您的公司很好，大概有99％的人以这种方式思考。

社交反弹？就像政治，不公正法律和盈利的社会反对一样？等一下，您甚至还没有看到社交反弹，这个世界即将在社交反弹的情况下爆炸。您将希望在电网上拥有一个宅基地。

我必须向人们解释这一事实，这表明了大多数人类已经走了多远。上帝已承诺不要再次淹没地球几乎是可惜的，我们可以真正使用重置。"

i was right with my 'insults' you're just another brick in the wall so to speak, readily admitting that you're too afraid to make any real changes in your own life that will actually make the world a better place for everybody while trying to grandstand about some humanitarian work or something that is completely unrelated... go back to your pasta, plastic goods, cheap cars and 9 to 5. you know you're never going to make a difference, you've already given up.","@johnvuu4679不...这不是不现实的。解释为什么？你没有争论，你只是说不。这很可能是您对潜意识的反应，已经认为您不想放弃当前的生活方式，因此您会以一些普遍的荒谬垃圾做出反应，例如“它是不现实的”，而没有任何解释，因为没有任何解释。

2870,UgzlklBUo0QIht1-LTp4AaABAg,0,"are you into marry and divorce? then you are a sinner. are you married to more than one person? repent!! marriage is between a man and a woman. marriage is for better and for worse until death separates (matthew 19:3-6). ‘wherefore they are no more two but one flesh. what therefore god has joined together let no man put asunder (separate)’. cheating on your wife or husband is sin. proverbs 28: 13 says, ‘‘he that covers his sins shall not prosper...you must repent of them, confess and forsake them (1 john 1:9). 
are you into worldliness? don’t you know that friendship with the world is enmity with god? (james 4:4; ii john2:15-17). so, you must stop bleaching your body or painting your mouth, eyes, hands and legs or fixing attachments, weave-on, earrings (genesis 35:2-4), bangles, chains and frying or perming your hair. tattooing your body is satanic. are you one of those that put on nude dresses, short skirts, transparent dresses to seduce men or women (a seducer or a promoter of lust is a sinner – mathew 5:28) 

perhaps you wear trousers as a woman? (read deuteronomy 22:5), that is an abomination (revelation 21:8, 27). therefore, make up your mind, repent and give your life to jesus christ. are you spoilt? jeremiah 4:30 says, ‘‘and when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee. they will seek thy life’’. (2 kings 9:30; hosea 2:13; exodus 33:1-6) 
a christian is not a sinner and a sinner is not a christian (i john 3:9). if you must be a blessed child of god, then you must repent of your sins and give your life to jesus christ. if you believe jesus christ today, righteousness of god will come into your life and abundant life will be your portion (1 john 11-12). if you neglect this call to repentance and salvation and die, you will not escape fire of hell (hebrews 2:3). it is foolishness and sin to say or think that there is no god (psalm 14:1; 9:17). luke 13:3, jesus said, ‘i tell you, nay: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish’. cut off every besetting sin (hebrew 12:1-2; mark 9:43-48). 

if you have decided now (2 corinthians 6:2) to give your life to jesus christ and to forsake your sinful lifestyle, please say this prayer: 
almighty god, i come unto you in the name of jesus. father i confess that i am a sinner. all my sins i confess to you. 
i am very sorry for all my sins (mention those you can remember). lord i promise you that from today i will never continue in them anymore. i believe that jesus christ died and rose again on the third day for my justification. 
almighty god, use the blood of jesus to wash my sins away. lord jesus, come into my heart, be my lord and personal saviour. i surrender my life to you. cancel my name from the books of death and write it in the book of life. give me power to sin no more. in jesus name i pray. amen!!

1john 1","您是结婚和离婚吗？那你是一个罪人。您与一个以上的人结婚了吗？悔改！！婚姻是男人和女人之间的。婚姻是更好，更糟的，直到死亡分开为止（马太福音19：3-6）。 ‘因此，除了一个肉之外，它们不再是两个。因此，上帝加在一起的是什么，没有人将其放在（分开）”。欺骗你的妻子或丈夫是罪。箴言28：13说：‘掩盖他的罪过的人不会繁荣……你必须悔改他们，承认并抛弃它们（约翰一书1：9）。
你是世俗的吗？您不知道与世界的友谊与上帝仇恨吗？ （James 4：4; II John2：15-17）。因此，您必须停止漂白身体或绘画嘴巴，眼睛，手和腿，或固定附件，编织，耳环（创世记35：2-4），手镯，链条以及煎炸或刺穿头发。纹身你的身体是撒旦的。您是穿上裸色连衣裙，短裙，透明的连衣裙引诱男人或女人的人之一（诱惑者或欲望的促进者是罪人 - 马修5:28）

也许你像女人一样穿裤子？ （阅读申命记22：5），这是一种可憎的（启示录21：8，27）。因此，下定决心，悔改，将您的生命献给耶稣基督。你被宠坏了吗？耶利米书4:30说：‘‘当你宠坏时，你做什么？尽管您用深红色给您带来最大的衣服，尽管您用黄金装饰着您的最大饰物，尽管您用绘画租了脸，但您徒劳地让您公平地让自己公平。你的恋人会鄙视你。他们会寻求你的生活’。 （2 Kings 9:30; Hosea 2:13;出埃及记33：1-6）
基督徒不是罪人，罪人不是基督徒（约翰一书3：9）。如果您必须是上帝的幸福孩子，那么您必须悔改自己的罪，并将生命献给耶稣基督。如果您相信今天的耶稣基督，上帝的公义就会进入您的生活，那么丰富的生活将是您的一部分（约翰一书11-12）。如果您忽略了悔改，救赎和死亡的呼吁，您将不会逃脱地狱之火（希伯来书2：3）。说或认为没有上帝是愚蠢和罪（诗篇14：1; 9:17）。路加福音13：3，耶稣说，‘我告诉你，不：但是，除了你们悔改，你们都会同样灭亡。”切断所有困扰的罪（希伯来语12：1-2；马可福音9：43-48）。

如果您现在决定（2哥林多前书6：2）将您的生命献给耶稣基督，并放弃您的罪恶生活方式，请说出这种祈祷：
全能的上帝，我以耶稣的名来给你。父亲我承认我是罪人。我向你认罪的所有罪过。
我为自己的所有罪恶感到非常抱歉（提及您记得的那些）。上帝，我向你保证，从今天开始，我将永远不再继续前进。我相信耶稣基督在第三天为我的理由而死。
全能的上帝，用耶稣的宝血将我的罪恶洗净。主耶稣，进入我的内心，成为我的主和个人救主。我向你投降。从死亡书中取消我的名字，然后在生命书中写下它。不再赋予我罪的力量。我以耶稣的名祈祷。阿们！

1089,Ugzl4rYjPHgbBj8vkcp4AaABAg,0,"faced with this person's heart more and more corrupted. the world where natural disasters and people are constantly, people have more and more conflicts, and more and more illegal things are. it is mentioned: you will hear the sound of fighting and fighting, don't panic. these things must be available, but the last period has not yet arrived. the people want to attack the people, the country must attack the country; there must be earthquakes and famines in many places. this is the beginning of disaster ...

in the distant past, the world of noah's life was like such corruption today. at that time, god regretted making people (all people thought at that time were all evil), so god wiped out with the floods (only stayed in staying (only stayed in staying because of his ""fear of god""), human ancestor adam, adam, chose to accept the temptation and did not follow god. from then on, he entered the world. today, our world, enjoy the convenience brought by technology, the emergence of the internet , make the world a global village, but people's relationships have become more complicated, violent porn information, etc., constantly seduce the world to sin, we live in a world of deceit happy, no longer respect others. this lifestyle makes us more and more farther away from god. it is also unpleasant to god. many people do not know the god who creates the universe or does not want to know god, does not want to know the gospel. it is superstitious, but the bible tells us that god was the versatile god that was in the past and eternal in the past, and god hated ""sin"". no longer the same, we have lost eternal life, life is limited, and god has set a day to judge the world according to the people (jesus) set up by his (jesus). god loves the world. the only sons jesus became a flesh, nailed to ten, and the life of our sinful life with his innocent life was resurrected three days after his death. sitting on the right of god jehovah, so that we could pardon through jesus, repentance and was baptized. the holy spirit believes that jesus becomes a savior, so that we have a new style, and then live according to the inspiration of the bible. jesus said: you have a lot of love for people, and you have more forgiveness. ; what amount do you use to give you, and what amount to use will be used to give you .. similar teaching bibles are inspired. if we are willing to obey, we will have the opportunity to save.

we live in the scientific era, and people no longer believe in god, but we can't see that it does not mean nothing. the busy life makes us have no time to think. what will we face after death? since the outbreak of the new crown virus, we are becoming more and more feeling the impermanence and fragility of life, jesus told us in lujia gospel: a sinner repent, and he must also happy for him in the sky, and he is more happy than ninety -nine righteous people who do not have to repent. god loves us to be close to him. we are all created in the style of god. we must never be punished because of sin, so the last days have been extended for a long time. they are looking for those who belong to him.
the gospel of john mentioned: jesus said, ""i am the road, truth, and life, and no one can get to the father if she doesn't use me.
dear friend, jesus christ is the grace of god. god's mercy on the world allows us to receive this grace in vain without paying any cost. the choice, please study the bible (with app) to understand god's grace and jesus' teaching of sin, or go to the church to understand the gospel, (there is a fake blessing to confuse the world, we need to distinguish it) family, i wish you peace.","面对这个人心愈来愈败坏ˋ天灾人祸不断的世界,人们冲突愈来愈多,不法的事情也愈来愈多,许多人的爱心渐渐冷淡,这些世界的景况,耶稣在马太福音里就有提到:你们将听见打仗和打仗的风声，不要惊慌。这些事是必须有的，只是末期还没有到。民要攻打民，国要攻打国；多处必有地震、饥荒。这都是灾难的起头..

在遥远的过去,挪亚生活的年代世界就犹如今天这样的败坏,当时神后悔造人(那时的人所思所想尽都是恶),于是神就用大洪水灭绝所有人(只有留下挪亚因为他""敬畏神""),人类祖先亚当ˋ夏娃选择接受诱惑而不顺从上帝,从此罪就入了世界,时至今日我们的世界,享受科技带来的便利性,网路的出现,让世界成为一个地球村,但是人们的关系也变的复杂,暴力ˋ色情资讯等等,不断的在诱惑世人犯罪,我们就生活一个诡诈ˋ谎言ˋ贪婪ˋ欲望无止境的世界里,人们追求自我快乐,不再尊重其他人,这样的生活方式让我们离上帝愈来愈遥远,也是上帝不喜悦的,很多人不清楚创造宇宙的上帝或者不想了解上帝,不想知道福音,认为时代那么进步这都是迷信,但是圣经告诉我们上帝是昔在ˋ今在ˋ以后永在的全能神,并且上帝恨恶""罪"",在亚当ˋ夏娃选择不顺从神的结果,让我们因为罪和圣洁的神属性不再一样,我们也失去永生,生命受到限制,而神已经定了日子，要借着祂所设立的人(耶稣)按公义审判天下,神爱世人.上帝在二千年前差了祂的独生子耶稣道成肉身,钉上十架,以祂无罪的生命代替我们有罪的生命赎罪,死后三天复活,坐在上帝耶和华神的右边,让我们可以借着耶稣罪得赦免,悔改ˋ受洗ˋ领受圣灵ˋ相信耶稣成为救主,让我们有新生的样式,之后按照圣经的启示来生活,耶稣说:您对人付出的爱多,您的赦免就多,你们怎样论断人，也必怎样被论断；你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们..类似的教导圣经都有启示,如果我们愿意顺服,都有机会得救.

我们活在科学时代,人不再相信有神,,不过看不到不代表没有,忙碌的生活让我们没有时间思考,人死后接下要面对什么?自从新冠病毒爆发以来,我们愈来愈感到生命的无常以及脆弱,耶稣在路加福音告诉我们:一个罪人悔改，在天上也要这样为他欢喜，较比为九十九个不用悔改的义人欢喜更大。神是喜爱我们亲近祂的,我们都是按着神的样式造的,绝对不要我们因为罪而受罚,所以末后的日子延长了很久,(耶稣离开2千年了)神要世人悔改归向祂,天天都在寻找归向祂的人.
约翰福音提到:耶稣说“我就是道路、真理、生命若不借着我，没有人能到父那里。
亲爱的朋友,耶稣基督就是神的恩典,神怜悯世人让我们不用付出什么代价就可以白白的领受这个恩典,末世的征兆愈来愈显明,在有限的生命里尽快的接受福音绝对是您最好的选择,恳请您研读圣经(有app)来了解神的恩典以及耶稣对罪的教导,或是到教会了解福音,(有假福音在迷惑世人,需要明辨)让我们一同进入神国的大家庭,祝平安ˋ喜乐."
