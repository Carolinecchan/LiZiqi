I am gonna go eat that snail"" or the first person to say ""Boy that frog looks yummy and I bet its legs would be tasty"". I should also point out that in Chinese the word for Frog (when you are using the term in the context of being a food, at least) basically translates into ""Field Chicken"". Specified the context because it has other names just like most things do based on the context of the discussion.","我继续不了解各种文化及其传统食物的一件事是，它首先是如何真正开始的。

当您查看吃一些相当不寻常的食物的文化时，这些食物似乎“粗糙”或“怪异”（蜗牛，青蛙，昆虫等），它们似乎并不存在于存在完全缺乏选择的地方，问题就变成了问题。 “为什么？”

我的意思是，您能想象有一天坐在河岸上的第一个人对自己或附近的人说：“你知道吗？我要去吃那蜗牛了”或第一个说“青蛙看起来的男孩好吃，我敢打赌它的腿会很美味”。我还应该指出，在中文中，青蛙一词（至少在作为食物的背景下使用该术语时）基本上会转化为“野鸡”。指定上下文，因为它具有其他名称，就像大多数事情一样，基于讨论的上下文。"

5981,UgxvAuJTFlMG5TuJm3F4AaABAg,0,"If you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about Liziqi ( Li Ziyi ): 

In 1990, Li Ziyi fell to the ground in Mianyang, Sichuan. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Later, her father died, and Li Ziyi became an orphan. His stepmother didnโ€t treat her well. Li Zizhen mentioned on Weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten. 

Grandpa and Grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take Li Ziyu home and live. When Li Ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. At the age of 14, Li Ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. Her first life was very hard. She slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months. 

Li Ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. In order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. Later, when talking about the matter, Li Zizhen frankly said: โ€I didnโ€t say that I liked music at that time, just to live, I felt that it was well paid.โ€ 

In 2012, because grandma was ill once, Li Ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. โ€Being closer, I feel more at ease.โ€ 

After returning, Li Ziyi opened a Taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. In 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, Li Ziyi was exposed to the short video platform Meipai. Until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on Meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of Taobao business, Li Ziyi re-entered Meipai to prepare for his own video program. 

The reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment. 

In an interview with the living room of Sina Club, Li Ziyi mentioned, โ€All these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. In the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places. 

In the beginning, Li Ziyi gave himself a topic called โ€Four Seasons Change, Eat While You Eatโ€. After the suggestion of Meipai editor, it became โ€Ancient Foodโ€ and it is still used today. 

In September 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for Li Ziyu to get more attention in the future. Sina Weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support. 

As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Liu Tongming brought her Weibo resources support. 

One day in September 2016, Li Feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private Weibo message from โ€Mr. Lโ€. Mr. L expressed his love for Li Ziyuโ€s video content, felt that he had fulfilled his Taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her. 

For a long time after that, Li Ziyi received Mr. Lโ€s private letter. โ€It would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. This is usChinaโ€s proud traditional culture should be seen by people in China and around the world. โ€Mr. L said in a private message. 

At first, after seeing these private messages, Li Ziyi didnโ€t care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. Until one day, Mr. L came to the city where Li Zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. Mr. Lโ€s politeness and clear logical thinking made Li slowly drop his initial alert. 

This accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of Li Zizhen. Not long after the meal was over, with the help of Mr. L, Li Zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on Sina Weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing Li Zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head. 

This experience is partly recorded in a diary of Li Zizheng that year. Some insiders close to the senior executives of Weinian Technology confirmed to Tencentโ€s โ€Shenwangโ€ that the โ€Mr. Lโ€ is actually Liu Tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. Daxiong Liu, the founder of Wei Nian Technology, an MCN company to which Li Zizhen now belongs. 

On December 8th, the reading volume of a Weibo topic labeled โ€Is Li Ziyi a cultural outputโ€ climbed to 800 million. Li Zizheng was once again on the hot search list. 

The video created by Li Ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now. 

Extensive overseas communication is an important reason for Li Zihuanโ€s renewed attention. Some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional Chinese culture and cuisine. Others think that her video is not completely true To reflect Chinaโ€s rural life. 

Even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a DJ, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life Itโ€s still just a fiction for character setting. 

An insider of Weinian Technology told Tencentโ€s โ€Deep Webโ€ that Li Ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by Li Ziyi himself. The popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. In fact, both Li Zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs. 

Until August 17, 2018, Li Ziyiโ€s eponymous Tmall store officially opened. Six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. A year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the Li Zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million. 
The value behind Li Ziyiโ€s IP is being quickly tapped. 

Li Ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. But now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements. 
According to Tianyan search, โ€Deep Webโ€ shows that MCN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., which Li Ziyi belongs to, was established on February 28, 2013, with a registered capital of RMB 5.208 million. According to the introduction, Wei Nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates KOL into IP through short videos and extends to consumer brands. 

The information of Qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark โ€Li Zihuanโ€. The applicant companies are Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd. The product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, Financial property management, catering and accommodation. 

Not only that, Wei Nian also has inextricable links with Li Ziyuโ€s companies. 

According to the eye inspection, Li Jiajia (should be the original name of Li Ziyu) established Sichuan Ziyu Culture Communication Co., Ltd. on July 20, 2017, and Wei Nian is its shareholder, holding 51% of the shares. Supervisor, Li Jiajia holds 49% of the shares. 

According to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., including Greenland Holdings, ZTE, Xinhua Media, Vanke, Light Media, etc. . 
Among the shareholders of Weinian Technology, Sina Weibo is particularly eye-catching. 

From Wei Nian Technology to Sina Weibo, Li Ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to. 
In her own words, she changed from โ€a little transparent to a person who is so useless to societyโ€. After entering the public view and being noticed by more people, Li Ziyiโ€s sense of responsibility has also become heavier. 
โ€I want to do what I can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non-heritage cultural craftsmen, and I want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. Li Ziyi said. 

Source: https://www.ww01.net/en/archives/33757","如果您在这里是新手，那么这绝对是您需要了解的有关Liziqi（Li Ziyi）的一切：

1990年，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）跌倒在四川米扬（Mianyang）。她的父母很小的时候就离婚了。后来，她的父亲去世了，李齐伊成为孤儿。他的继母对她不好。李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）在微博上提到，当他的继母将头发拖入排水沟并被殴打时，他有半死的经历。

爷爷和奶奶使孙女感到沮丧，最后决定带李Ziyu回家。当李齐伊（Li Ziyi）五年级时，他的祖父再次去世，他的祖母很难抚养她继续上学。李齐（Li Ziyi）在14岁时不得不辍学，独自去城市努力工作，并开始了八年的流浪生活。她的第一人生非常艰难。她睡在公园椅上，挠头两个月。

Li Ziyi还曾在酒店担任服务生，每月薪水为300元。为了赚取更多的收入，她去学习演奏唱片并在酒吧里唱歌。后来，在谈论此事时，李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）坦率地说：“我不是说当时我喜欢音乐，只是为了生活，我觉得这是付出的。”

2012年，由于奶奶曾经生病，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）担心她后来会后悔，扔掉所有工作并返回奶奶。 “靠近，我感到更加放松。”

返回后，李Ziyi开了一家淘宝商店，但业务一直在运行，他几乎没有吃饭。 2015年，在他的弟弟的影响下，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）接触了短视频平台Meipai。直到2016年，看到他的弟弟在Meipai上有一些粉丝，并且拥有更多的粉丝可以改善淘宝业务的心态，Li Ziyi重新进入Meipai，为自己的视频节目做准备。

她之所以选择以这种风格拍摄视频与她的童年环境密切相关的原因。

李·齐（Li Ziyi）在接受西那俱乐部（Nina Club）的客厅采访时说：“所有这些在农村自给自足的事情，对我来说，它们嫉妒。在简短的视频中，她选择从最熟悉的地方开始。

一开始，李齐伊（Li Ziyi）称自己为“四个季节变化，吃饭时吃饭”。在Meipai编辑的建议之后，它变成了“古老的食物”，并且今天仍然使用。

2016年9月，一个新的机会悄悄地出现了，这也成为李Zyu将来更加关注的重要推动者。 Sina Weibo开始公开寻找更多出色的简短视频创建者以获得资源支持。

正如文章开头所述，刘·汤明（Liu Tongming）为她带来了微博的资源支持。

2016年9月的一天，古老的简短视频博客作者Li Feng意外收到了“先生先生的私人微博消息”。 L”。 L先生表达了对李Ziyu的视频内容的热爱，觉得他已经实现了他的作陶王的梦，并希望与她见面。

此后很长一段时间，Li Ziyi收到了L先生的私人信。 “这样一个好视频让这个人看到它是可惜的。这是中国和世界各地的人们应该看到USCHINA骄傲的传统文化。 “先生。我在一条私人消息中说。

起初，在看到这些私人消息后，李Ziyi并不在乎太多，甚至不必担心遇到骗子。直到一天，L先生来到了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）所在的城市，并想请她吃饭和聊天。 L先生的礼貌和清晰的逻辑思维使李慢慢地放弃了最初的警报。

这次偶然的会议彻底改变了李·齐兴（Li Zizhen）的生活轨迹。用餐结束后不久，在L先生的帮助下，李·Zizheng（Li Zizheng）得到了Sina Weibo的大量资源的支持，加快了她的知名度，并允许Li Zizhen赶到头部网络影响者的排队。

这种经历部分记录在那年的李Zizheng日记中。一些与温尼安技术高级管理人员接近的内部人士证实了腾讯的“申旺”，即“先生先生L”实际上是刘·汤明（Liu Tongming），他的化名是公开报道的。 Wei Nian Technology的创始人Daxiong Liu是Li Zizhen现在属于的MCN公司。

12月8日，一个标有“是文化产出”的微博主题的阅读量攀升至8亿。李Zizheng再次在热门搜索列表中。

Li Ziyi和她创建的视频现在已成为一个值得研究的现象。

广泛的海外沟通是李齐伊安（Li Zihuan）重新关注的重要原因。有人说她已经拍摄了理想的乡村生活，并传播了中国传统文化和美食的魅力。其他人则认为她的视频并非完全正确地反映中国的乡村生活。

自从爆炸再次提出以来一直很受欢迎的疑问，例如成为DJ，成为富人的第二代，无论是我自己的视频，是否有强烈的推动力，视频是真的对于农村生活，这仍然是角色环境的小说。

Weinian Technology的一位内部人士告诉Tencent的“ Deep Web”，Li Ziyi是普通的，相关的视频内容是由Li Ziyi本人制作的。受欢迎程度不是公司和他本人的倡议。实际上，他背后的李·齐伊安（Li Zihuan）和微读团队都非常低调，他们非常热情，拒绝了当前的所有采访需求。

直到2018年8月17日，Li Ziyi的同名TMALL商店正式开业。上网六天后，当时只有五种产品的商店的销售额超过150,000，销售额超过1000万。一年后，李Zizhen旗舰店展示的21种产品的总销售额超过130万，总销售额达到7100万。
Li Ziyi的IP背后的价值正在迅速挖掘。

Li Ziyi从头开始，并以自己的力量获得了第一批粉丝。但是现在，声名和财富的受欢迎程度和收益显然不再只是她的成就。
根据Tianyan Search的说法，“ Deep Web”表明，Li Ziyi属于的McN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。于2013年2月28日成立，其注册资本为5.208亿元。根据引言，Wei Nian是一家娱乐娱乐公司，通过简短的视频将KOL孵化为IP，并扩展到消费者品牌。

Qixinbao的信息表明，商标“ Li Zihuan”有100多种知识产权信息。申请人公司是Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。产品类别包括食品，服装，鞋子和帽子，染料和脂肪，染料和脂肪，啤酒和饮料，金融物业管理，餐饮和住宿。

不仅如此，Wei Nian还与Li Ziyu的公司建立了不可忽视的联系。

根据眼睛检查，李亚吉亚（应该是李祖的原始名称）于2017年7月20日成立了四川Ziyu文化传播公司有限公司。主管Li Jiajia持有49％的股份。

根据其他数据，Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co.，Ltd。的背后有多达50家受益公司，包括Greenland Holdings，ZTE，新华社媒体，Vanke，Light Media等。
在Weinian技术的股东中，Sina Weibo特别引人注目。

从Wei Nian Technology到Sina Weibo，Li Ziyi逐渐拥有互联网名人期待的最佳卡片。
用她自己的话说，她从“有点透明变成了一个对社会无用的人”。在进入公众观点并被更多人注意到之后，李齐的责任感也变得更加重。
“我想尽我所能，做更多对社会有益的事情，例如传统文化，非遗产文化工匠的传播，我想向所有人展示这些旧事物，以便更多的人知道。李Ziyi说。

While the word nature in the soul transmits the impression of stability and non -change, man appears in general, and the contemporary person in particular, a historical and variable being, his changes are accelerated in our time. Is it possible to say that a person is unique to the rest of the neighborhoods that he has no nature, or that every perception of human nature is a historical perception, which condemns his time more than what is supposed to be our mountain or our fixed formation? And when we look around us, we see that our partners in life, including animals and plants, seem programmers on the same deeds and interactions throughout their lives, unlike us. Singer does not have a date, it does the same things every year in a cycle ... normal. Senjab has a nature, although we do not know what is going on in the head of the squirrel, and what does the neighborhood mean that the neighborhood is a bond. Man has a history in return, and it seems that we have a history because we have no nature.

But it seems that a person has no clear nature. We are distributed over two sexes, and we multiply with reproduction, and the young people are breastfed by mothers milk, and we need us in general and more so that we can walk, we walk on legs like birds but we do not fly like them, and if you did not sleep in an accident or kill each other for each other, we die a ""natural"" death of old age, It is rare for one or one of us to live a century. But we speak after two or three years, alone about other animals in the language. Despite the multiplicity of our languages, it is not among us who are without a language, and the speaker of any language can multiply by intermarriage from the speaker of any other language, which means that we are similar biological, that is, we have one ""nature"". This is important against the ""racists"" of human beings. They deny the natural unity of humans, that is, the unity of the human element, but rather decide the large number of human elements and their salary as fixed, or natural data. In fact, the concept of nature that can be based on refuting racist claims can also be reassured to defend them.

Moreover, a person is a product of a development of a life on the planet of about four billion years old, which means that the potential distinction of his nature is one of the possibilities of this life, through the process of ""natural election"" in which the best and the most able to inherit its preferences win, and it comes out of the weakest race. With these images, what seems to be out of nature is the same as natural data.

2
It seems that our current formation is fixed for hundreds of thousands of years and more, and that we have passed millions of years ago with stages during which our stature erected and our skulls expanded, and we took a symbol and made tools.

For thousands of years our history seems to be the history of what we do and create, not a natural development history, such as our development in the times of the foot. Is this a short separation, which leads us to something after it? After thousands or tens of thousands of years, is it possible that our capabilities are being seen today, based on language and thought, as natural evolutionary features, which led to widespread destruction of the planet, and perhaps to delete the being who possessed these features and restore the planet and life on them? We will have a possibility of nature, destroying himself according to what might be called the natural principle of cunning. This does not seem completely excluded. It may not happen by the action of the nuclear bomb, but rather the genetic bomb, interference in the human genetic record, that is, in the ""nature"" of man in a way that produces different natures or ""elements"", the difference between us is close to us and chimpanzees, for example, and mating and reproduction may refrain from arrival To this threshold. In other words, the true racism in front of us, whether by manufacturing human beings, may not be rebellious or protected, slaves in their nature, as if they are useful pets, which are beneficial to them that they speak and reason; Or through the production of superheroes who use us, we are ordinary, as slaves to them, and they see them crowding out for them on the planet and there is nothing wrong with killing hundreds of millions or billions of us, and perhaps in this they are armed with force and capabilities that we do not kiss to confront them.

3
This brings us back to the question about the human nature: What is the nature of the living being who seems able to change its nature? Does the concept of nature remain good when it seems that it does not refrain from changing it, who are supposed to change it? To make new natures for themselves or others? When the organism has natures instead of one nature? Or when it is possible that it is distinguished for organisms, each of which is its nature? The change of man to the ""mind"" of the language of the language (speaking with others, and the soul, from the world), and as a social evolutionary production. This ability has evolved historically, and just a few centuries ago, it presented itself the possibility of ""sovereignty"" on the nature and ""ownership"". ""Sovereign"" progress has been achieved at specific levels, but its price was exorbitant as it was presented: the extinction of many neighborhood partners for us, the heating of the planet, and the threat of life on it, as well as the severe forms of discrimination between the human beings themselves, including extension of the indigenous population in two continents by the European controlles. And among them is an intercontinental commercial slavery, which blacks suffered more than others. This is at a time when perceptions such as man, his rights and humanity were heard more than ever.

Is it possible that we are wondering today about the nature of man because we are touching something unnatural in ourselves, threatening the nature from which we descend?

What is this abnormal thing? Perhaps a special ability for our brain and nervous system, is evolutionary (expanding the skull and the erection of the list) and socially (through language and a broader groups) on the rationality and obstruction of other beings, and ""arrest"" - they, including some people or many of them or more, are what we call the mind . Man is a ""speaking animal"" in the sense of sane. Perhaps the social person invented or developed cultures and religions as a matter of ""mind"" himself in particular, and from them in particular his developing nervous system anxious. The social person has produced these beliefs and rules, or ""culture"", in order to be an external mind that controls his inner, extremely internal mind, giving him customs and traditions, repetitive paths that help him have a continent's nature, or compensate him for the loss of his animal. A form of a ""detainee"" of this abnormal, natural object.","1
尽管灵魂中的大自然一词传递了稳定和不变的印象，但人类总体而言，尤其是当代人，一个历史和变量，他的变化在我们时代加速了。是否可以说，一个人是其余社区独有的，他没有天性，或者对人性的每一种看法都是一种历史感，这谴责了他的时间，而不是应该是我们的山上或我们的固定的时间编队？当我们环顾四周时，我们会看到生活中的伴侣，包括动物和植物，看上去像我们一生都在相同的行为和互动上的程序员，与我们不同。歌手没有约会，它每年在周期中做同样的事情……正常。 Senjab具有性质，尽管我们不知道松鼠的负责人正在发生什么，而该社区意味着该社区是一种纽带。人有回报的历史，而且似乎我们有历史，因为我们没有天性。

但是看来一个人没有明确的本性。我们分布在两个性别上，我们会随繁殖而繁殖，年轻人被母亲牛奶母乳喂养，我们通常需要我们，以便我们可以走路，我们可以像鸟一样走路，但我们不会像它们那样飞翔，如果您不在事故中睡觉或彼此杀死，我们将死于老年人的“自然”死亡，我们中的一个或一个世纪很少生活。但是我们在两三年之后讲话，独自一人谈论其他语言的动物。尽管我们的语言有多种多样，但我们中没有任何语言，任何语言的说话者都可以通过任何其他语言的说话者过婚，这意味着我们是相似的生物学，也就是说，我们有一种“自然”。这对人类的“种族主义者”很重要。他们否认人类的自然统一，即人的元素的统一，而是将大量人类因素及其工资确定为固定或自然数据。实际上，也可以放心可以基于反驳种族主义主张的自然概念来捍卫它们。

此外，一个人是大约40亿年历史的地球上生命发展的产物，这意味着他的本性的潜在区别是通过“自然选举”的过程之一最好和最能够继承其偏好的能力，这是最弱的种族。有了这些图像，似乎出于自然的图像与自然数据相同。

2
似乎我们目前的形成固定了数十万年以上，并且我们已经通过了数百万年前的阶段，在此期间，我们的身材竖立了，我们的头骨扩大了，我们采用了符号并制造了工具。

数千年来，我们的历史似乎是我们所做和创造的历史，而不是自然发展历史，例如我们脚时代的发展。这是一个短暂的分离，这使我们陷入了困境吗？经过数千年或数十千年的历史，今天，我们的能力可能是基于语言和思想，作为自然进化特征，这导致了地球的广泛破坏，也许是删除拥有这些特征的存在的人并恢复地球和生命吗？我们将有大自然的可能性，根据所谓的狡猾的自然原则摧毁自己。这似乎并没有完全排除。它可能不是通过核弹的作用而发生的，而是遗传炸弹的干预，即人类遗传记录，即人的“自然”，以产生不同的本质或“元素”，这之间的差异例如，我们与我们接近，黑猩猩，交配和繁殖可能避免到达这个门槛。换句话说，我们面前的真正种族主义，无论是通过制造人类而不是叛逆或受到保护的奴隶，就好像它们是有用的宠物一样，对他们说话和理性有益的宠物；或通过使用我们的超级英雄的生产，我们是普通的，是他们的奴隶，他们看到他们在地球上为他们拥挤，杀死我们数亿或数十亿或数十亿美元，也许在这方面没有错武装的力量和能力我们不会亲吻与他们面对。

3
这使我们回到了关于人本性的问题：似乎能够改变其性质的生物的本质是什么？自然的概念似乎不避免改变它，谁应该改变它？为自己或他人创造新的本性？当有机体具有天性而不是一种性质时？或者，当它有可能以生物为特色时，每种都是它的本质？人的语言（与他人，灵魂，来自世界）的语言的“思想”和社会进化论的变化。这种能力从历史上发展了，就在几个世纪前，它表明了对性质和“所有权”的“主权”的可能性。 “主权”在特定层面取得了进步，但其价格却高昂：许多邻里合作伙伴的灭绝，地球的供暖以及生命的威胁以及严重的形式人类本身之间的歧视，包括欧洲控制局在两个大陆上扩大土著人口。其中是洲际商业奴隶制，黑人比其他人遭受的苦难更大。在这个时候，诸如人类，他的权利和人性之类的观念比以往任何时候都更加听到。

今天，我们有可能想知道人的本性，因为我们在自己触摸了自己的不自然事物，威胁到我们下降的本性？

这是什么异常的事情？对于我们的大脑和神经系统来说，也许是一种特殊的能力，它是进化（扩大头骨和清单的架设）以及在社会上（通过语言和更广泛的群体）在其他生物的理性和妨碍方面（通过语言和更广泛的群体），以及“逮捕”包括某些人或许多人或更多人或更多人是我们所说的思想。从理智的意义上讲，人是一种“说话的动物”。也许社会人士特别是“思想”本人，特别是从他们发明或发展的文化和宗教，尤其是从他们发展的神经系统焦虑中。社会人士制定了这些信念和规则或“文化”，以成为一个外部思想，可以控制他内在的，极其内在的思想，给他习俗和传统，重复的道路，可以帮助他拥有大陆的本性或补偿他因为失去了动物。这种异常自然物体的“拘留者”形式。"

万里长城、孔子、旗袍在历史上都是韩国的文化。 孔子出生在韩国的庆州，有韩国血统的父母，万里长城是韩国人为保护韩半岛免遭敌人袭击而建造的。 旗袍也是韩服中变形的衣服。 韩国人想打扮的时候穿韩服，睡觉的时候没有格调的场合穿旗袍。 现在可以看到中国的少数民族穿旗袍，那是借着很久之前的韩国文化维持至今的。

One point I really like about Ziqi is that she has a dedication and passion of sharing Chinese culture to the world. It’s something that many people would like to do but somehow lack of ability or determination. We should all believe her because as audiences, we feel it. We should offer more encouragement and appreciation. What’s most important that she really delivers peace and calmness to audiences and we all receive positive influences or energy from her videos. And I reallyyyy like her temperament.",大卫·哈钦斯（David Hutchins）仍然有许多人过着与中国相似的生活方式。我真的很喜欢Ziqi的一点是，她对与世界分享中国文化的奉献精神和热情。这是许多人想做的事情，但某种程度上缺乏能力或决心。我们都应该相信她，因为作为观众，我们感受到了。我们应该提供更多的鼓励和赞赏。最重要的是，她真正为观众提供和平与平静，我们都从她的视频中获得了积极的影响或精力。我真的很喜欢她的气质。

23731,UgxGkA6SigRoge5Q6JF4AaABAg,0,"You are such an amazing woman. I'm so amazed I can't even believe this could possibly be real. Right in the middle of making her soup she has to walk out into the environment, then find the particular ingredients she needs and and then she has to extract them from the earth which takes time, and then she has to bring them all the way back to her house and and then she has to wash them and prep them and then she has to wash her hands which they also don't show on camera and all this time the fire is still cooking the rest of the ingredients while she's doing all this. I don't see how this could be possible. If you add up all the time it takes to do that it would seem that the food would have been long boiled away. But in the next camera shot it appears as though she's only been gone a few minutes. I still think she is the most amazing woman I've ever seen though.so much talent and knowledge at a young age.Your culture is very very beautiful in your home too. Everybody should try to live their life like you do. Thank you for sharing with us.",你真是个了不起的女人。我很惊讶，我什至不敢相信这可能是真实的。就在做汤的过程中，她必须走进环境，然后找到所需的特定成分，然后她必须从地球上提取它们需要时间，然后她必须将它们一路带回到她的房子，然后她必须洗净并准备它们，然后她必须洗手，这些手也不在相机上显示，而这一切都在做所有这些时仍在烹饪其余的食材。我看不出这是怎么可能的。如果您所有的时间都需要做，那么似乎食物将长期沸腾。但是在下一个相机拍摄中，看起来她好像只有几分钟了。我仍然认为她是我见过的最神奇的女人。这很小的人才和知识。您的家中的文化也非常美丽。每个人都应该像您一样尝试过自己的生活。多谢与我们分享。
