(ive also shown these videos to my dad and he also loves them, my entire family is full of cooks so this was a breath of fresh air)",我妈妈每天都会每天煮正宗的菲律宾食物，而大约一年前，她失去了与癌症的斗争后，我从来没有像从学校回家回家的感觉，闻到了有史以来最令人惊叹的食物。您的视频带回了这些记忆，食物的煎炸在您的视频中听起来一样，她在锅中扔食物，锅上的金属刮擦，我什至可以闻到屏幕上发生的事情。您的视频使我免于忘记她，您的视频在那些黑暗的时期帮助了我，尽管它不是菲律宾的食物，但您的烹饪方式与我妈妈的烹饪方式如此相似。谢谢你。 （我还向我的父亲展示了这些视频，他也爱他们，我的整个家庭都充满了厨师，所以这是新鲜空气的呼吸）

3065,UgxK7tTx9vC9pt59mmJ4AaABAg,634,1 year ago (edited),"as we can see in the videos, the background of the forest, farms, yards, cooking stoves and utensils are real. in the past especially for the chinese people our ancestors work hard on every inch of lands they have. they make use of everything that nature provides to them. generation by generations the land grew flourish. this final generation from baby boomers era (like the grandma) likely the last of their kind, because due to the changes of modern and tech/gadjets world. not many still living up the life just like showed in the video because the generation x,y and z are working and living in cities to find income and mostly leaving the old man/woman at their village. in the end leaving the lands and farms unattended (because grandpa/grandma are already old to work and care the lands).
most end up selling their land and the money the new generation get were invested in businesses, building or renovating house in the cities or in another country, etc. 
as you saw in the video, you can see herbs, clean ponds and rivers, varieties of vegetations, animals like birds, chicken, duck, are well taken care of. these are their daily source of food because there are no supermarket nearby where you can buy from there. thus, why need to buy if you can get it fresh from your own farm? chinese are particular in what they eat (diets and healthy) so they grew herbs, vegetables and live stocks. that is how the baby boomers generation survived along the years away from town or cities. 
the beautiful lady is one of the most impressive grandchild in her family. not just beautiful but also hardworking, diligent, caring and humble because she still carry on her family's tradition and the lands. she learns all sorts of cooking, fermenting, recipes could be mostly from her grandparents which is oustanding. 
i too once lived like hers until i was 19 years old and i loves everything just like hers until my grandma passed away and the land was sold by my uncle that year. 
the memories i had never perish. i still remember the smell in the morning when i'm standing in the middle of the farm, the morning dewdrops on the leaves and grasses, the sounds of birds and water flowing in the small river, the bamboo forests in the evening like golden, chasing gooses, collecting the chicken eggs, collecting the sap from rubber trees, the soothing cold wind on the pepper farm hills, catching grasshoppers among the grasses, catching fireflies at night, the smell of firewood burning while boiling hot water, the food that my grandma used to cooked, my cousin shouting from afar teasing me while plucking potatoes from the ground, etc. i misses all that when i watched the video. 
i did went back to the village a few years ago but it wasnt the same anymore and the place changed alot and the farm wasnt like it used to be like. the peaceful life that i missed.","正如我们在视频中所看到的那样，森林，农场，院子，烹饪炉和餐具的背景是真实的。过去，尤其是对于中国人民，我们祖先在拥有的每一英寸土地上都在努力工作。他们利用自然界提供的一切。几代人的一代人的土地蓬勃发展。来自婴儿潮一代时代（像奶奶一样）的最后一代可能是同类的最后一代，因为由于现代和技术/gadjets世界的变化。 X，Y和Z一代在城市工作并居住在城市中，并大部分将老人/女人留在他们的村庄里，所以并没有多少人像视频中的生活那样过上生活。最后，离开土地和农场无人看管（因为爷爷/祖母已经在工作和照顾土地上已经老了）。
大多数人最终出售了他们的土地，以及新一代获得的资金投资于企业，在城市或另一个国家建造或翻新房屋等。
正如您在视频中看到的那样，您可以看到草药，干净的池塘和河流，各种植被，鸟类，鸡肉，鸭子等动物。这些是他们的日常食物来源，因为附近没有超市可以从那里购买。因此，如果您可以从自己的农场获得新鲜，为什么还需要购买呢？中国人在吃的东西（饮食和健康）中是特别的，因此他们种植了草药，蔬菜和活蛋。这就是婴儿潮一代在远离城镇或城市的几年中生存的方式。
美丽的女士是她家庭中最令人印象深刻的孙子之一。不仅美丽，而且勤奋，勤奋，关怀和谦虚，因为她仍然具有家人的传统和土地。她了解各种烹饪，发酵，食谱可能主要来自她的祖父母，这是罢工的。
我曾经像她一样像她一样生活，直到我19岁，我都喜欢像她这样的一切，直到我的祖母去世，那一年我的叔叔出售了这片土地。
我从未灭亡的记忆。我仍然记得早晨，当我站在农场中间时，早晨的气味，叶子和草地上的碎屑，小河中鸟类和水的声音，傍晚的竹林像金色一样，追逐鸡蛋，收集鸡蛋，从橡胶树中收集树液，在胡椒农场山上舒缓的冷风，在草中捕捉蚱hoppers，在晚上捕获萤火虫，柴火的气味在沸腾的热水时燃烧，食物，我是我的食物。奶奶曾经煮过，我的堂兄从远处大喊大叫，一边从地上摘下土豆，等等。
几年前，我确实回到了村庄，但不再一样，这个地方改变了很多，农场不像以前那样。我错过的和平生活。"
